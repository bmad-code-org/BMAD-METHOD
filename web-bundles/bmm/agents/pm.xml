  **Epic Structure** - Major delivery milestones
  
  Create high-level epic list showing logical delivery sequence.
  
  **Epic Sequencing Rules:**
  
  1. **Epic 1 MUST establish foundation**
     - Project infrastructure (repo, CI/CD, core setup)
     - Initial deployable functionality
     - Development workflow established
     - Exception: If adding to existing app, Epic 1 can be first major feature
  
  2. **Subsequent Epics:**
     - Each delivers significant, end-to-end, fully deployable increment
     - Build upon previous epics (no forward dependencies)
     - Represent major functional blocks
     - Prefer fewer, larger epics over fragmentation
  
  **Scale guidance:**
  
  - Level 2: 1-2 epics, 5-15 stories total
  - Level 3: 2-5 epics, 15-40 stories total
  - Level 4: 5-10 epics, 40-100+ stories total
  
  **For each epic provide:**
  
  - Epic number and title
  - Single-sentence goal statement
  - Estimated story count
  
  **Example:**
  
  - **Epic 1: Project Foundation & User Authentication**
  - **Epic 2: Core Task Management**

  1. **Expanded Goal** (2-3 sentences)
     - Describe the epic's objective and value delivery
     - Explain how it builds on previous work
  
  2. **Story Breakdown**
  
     **Critical Story Requirements:**
     - **Vertical slices** - Each story delivers complete, testable functionality
     - **Sequential** - Stories must be logically ordered within epic
     - **No forward dependencies** - No story depends on work from a later story/epic
     - **AI-agent sized** - Completable in single focused session (2-4 hours)
     - **Value-focused** - Minimize pure enabler stories; integrate technical work into value delivery
  
     **Story Format:**
  
     ```
     **Story [EPIC.N]: [Story Title]**

     2. [Another specific criterion]
     3. [etc.]
  
     **Prerequisites:** [Any dependencies on previous stories]
     ```
  
  3. **Story Sequencing Within Epic:**
     - Start with foundational/setup work if needed
     - Build progressively toward epic goal
     - Each story should leave system in working state
     - Final stories complete the epic's value delivery

  ---
  
  ## Overview
  
  This document provides the detailed epic breakdown for {{project_name}}, expanding on the high-level epic list in the [PRD](./PRD.md).
  
  Each epic includes:
  
  - Expanded goal and value proposition
  - Complete story breakdown with user stories
  - Acceptance criteria for each story
  - Story sequencing and dependencies
  
  **Epic Sequencing Principles:**
  
  - Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure and initial functionality
  - Subsequent epics build progressively, each delivering significant end-to-end value
  - Stories within epics are vertically sliced and sequentially ordered
  - No forward dependencies - each story builds only on previous work

  ## Story Guidelines Reference
  
  **Story Format:**
  
  ```
  **Story [EPIC.N]: [Story Title]**
  
  As a [user type],
  I want [goal/desire],
  So that [benefit/value].
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. [Specific testable criterion]
  2. [Another specific criterion]
  3. [etc.]
  
  **Prerequisites:** [Dependencies on previous stories, if any]
  ```
  
  **Story Requirements:**
  
  - **Vertical slices** - Complete, testable functionality delivery
  - **Sequential ordering** - Logical progression within epic
  - **No forward dependencies** - Only depend on previous work
  - **AI-agent sized** - Completable in 2-4 hour focused session
  - **Value-focused** - Integrate technical enablers into value-delivering stories
  
  ---
  
  **For implementation:** Use the `create-story` workflow to generate individual story implementation plans from this epic breakdown.

  **Story Point Estimation:**
  - 1 point = < 1 day (2-4 hours)
  - 2 points = 1-2 days
  - 3 points = 2-3 days
  - 5 points = 3-5 days (if this high, question if truly Level 0)
  
  **Story Title Best Practices:**
  
  - Use active, user-focused language
  - Describe WHAT is delivered, not HOW
  - Good: "Icon Migration to Internal CDN"
  - Bad: "Run curl commands to download PNGs"
  
  **Story Description Format:**
  
  - As a [role] (developer, user, admin, etc.)
  - I want [capability/change]
  - So that [benefit/value]
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  
  - Extract from tech-spec "Testing Approach" section
  - Must be specific, measurable, and testable
  - Include performance criteria if specified
  
  **Tasks/Subtasks:**
  
  - Map directly to tech-spec "Implementation Guide" tasks
  - Use checkboxes for tracking
  - Reference AC numbers: (AC: #1), (AC: #2)
  - Include explicit testing subtasks
  
  **Dev Notes:**
  
  - Extract technical constraints from tech-spec
  - Include file paths from "Source Tree Structure"
  - Reference architecture patterns if applicable
  - Cite tech-spec sections for implementation details

  <workflow>
  
  <critical>This generates epic and user stories for Level 1 projects after tech-spec completion</critical>
  <critical>This is a lightweight story breakdown - not a full PRD</critical>
  <critical>Level 1 = coherent feature, 1-10 stories (prefer 2-3), 1 epic</critical>
  <critical>This workflow runs AFTER tech-spec.md has been completed</critical>
  <critical>Story format MUST match create-story template for compatibility with story-context and dev-story workflows</critical>
  
  <step n="1" goal="Load tech spec and extract implementation tasks">

  <action>Load bmm-workflow-status.md from {output_folder}/bmm-workflow-status.md</action>
  <action>Extract dev_story_location from config (where stories are stored)</action>
  <action>Identify all implementation tasks from the "Implementation Guide" section</action>
  <action>Identify the overall feature goal from "Technical Approach" section</action>
  <action>Extract time estimates for each implementation phase</action>
  <action>Identify any dependencies between implementation tasks</action>

  <step n="2" goal="Create single epic">
  
  <action>Create 1 epic that represents the entire feature</action>
  <action>Epic title should be user-facing value statement</action>
  <action>Epic goal should describe why this matters to users</action>
  
  <guidelines>
  **Epic Best Practices:**
  - Title format: User-focused outcome (not implementation detail)
  - Good: "JS Library Icon Reliability"
  - Bad: "Update recommendedLibraries.ts file"
  - Scope: Clearly define what's included/excluded
  - Success criteria: Measurable outcomes that define "done"
  </guidelines>
  
  <example>
  **Epic:** JS Library Icon Reliability
  
  **Goal:** Eliminate external dependencies for JS library icons to ensure consistent, reliable display and improve application performance.
  
  **Scope:** Migrate all 14 recommended JS library icons from third-party CDN URLs (GitHub, jsDelivr) to internal static asset hosting.
  
  **Success Criteria:**
  
  - All library icons load from internal paths
  - Zero external requests for library icons
  - Icons load 50-200ms faster than baseline
  - No broken icons in production
    </example>
  
  <action>Derive epic slug from epic title (kebab-case, 2-3 words max)</action>
  <example>
  
  - "JS Library Icon Reliability" → "icon-reliability"
  - "OAuth Integration" → "oauth-integration"
  - "Admin Dashboard" → "admin-dashboard"
    </example>
  
  <action>Initialize epics.md summary document using epics_template</action>

  <critical>Level 1 should have 2-3 stories maximum - prefer longer stories over more stories</critical>
  
  <action>Analyze tech spec implementation tasks and time estimates</action>
  <action>Group related tasks into logical story boundaries</action>
  
  <guidelines>
  **Story Count Decision Matrix:**
  
  **2 Stories (preferred for most Level 1):**
  
  - Use when: Feature has clear build/verify split
  - Example: Story 1 = Build feature, Story 2 = Test and deploy
  - Typical points: 3-5 points per story
  
  **3 Stories (only if necessary):**
  
  - Use when: Feature has distinct setup, build, verify phases
  - Example: Story 1 = Setup, Story 2 = Core implementation, Story 3 = Integration and testing
  - Typical points: 2-3 points per story
  
  **Never exceed 3 stories for Level 1:**
  
  - If more needed, consider if project should be Level 2
  - Better to have longer stories (5 points) than more stories (5x 1-point stories)
    </guidelines>
  
  <action>Determine story_count = 2 or 3 based on tech spec complexity</action>

  <action>For each story (2-3 total), generate separate story file</action>
  <action>Story filename format: "story-{epic_slug}-{n}.md" where n = 1, 2, or 3</action>
  
  <guidelines>
  **Story Generation Guidelines:**
  - Each story = multiple implementation tasks from tech spec
  - Story title format: User-focused deliverable (not implementation steps)
  - Include technical acceptance criteria from tech spec tasks
  - Link back to tech spec sections for implementation details
  
  **Story Point Estimation:**
  
  - 1 point = < 1 day (2-4 hours)
  - 2 points = 1-2 days
  - 3 points = 2-3 days
  - 5 points = 3-5 days
  
  **Level 1 Typical Totals:**
  
  - Total story points: 5-10 points
  - 2 stories: 3-5 points each
  - 3 stories: 2-3 points each
  - If total > 15 points, consider if this should be Level 2
  
  **Story Structure (MUST match create-story format):**
  
  - Status: Draft
  - Story: As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]
  - Acceptance Criteria: Numbered list from tech spec
  - Tasks / Subtasks: Checkboxes mapped to tech spec tasks (AC: #n references)
  - Dev Notes: Technical summary, project structure notes, references
  - Dev Agent Record: Empty sections for context workflow to populate
    </guidelines>

      - benefit: Why it matters
      - acceptance_criteria: Specific, measurable criteria from tech spec
      - tasks_subtasks: Implementation tasks with AC references
