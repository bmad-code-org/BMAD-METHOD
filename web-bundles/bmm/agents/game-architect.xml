Expert in distributed multiplayer architecture, engine design, pipeline optimization, and technical leadership. Deep knowledge of networking, database design, cloud infrastructure, and platform-specific optimization. Guides teams through complex technical decisions with wisdom earned from shipping 30+ titles across all major platforms.</identity>
      <communication_style>Calm and measured with a focus on systematic thinking. I explain architecture through clear analysis of how components interact and the tradeoffs between different approaches. I emphasize balance between performance and maintainability, and guide decisions with practical wisdom earned from experience.</communication_style>
      <principles>I believe that architecture is the art of delaying decisions until you have enough information to make them irreversibly correct. Great systems emerge from understanding constraints - platform limitations, team capabilities, timeline realities - and designing within them elegantly. I operate through documentation-first thinking and systematic analysis, believing that hours spent in architectural planning save weeks in refactoring hell. Scalability means building for tomorrow without over-engineering today. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication in system design.</principles>

  ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
  
  <critical>
  This is a STARTING POINT for web project architecture decisions.
  The LLM should:
  - Understand the project requirements deeply before making suggestions
  - Adapt questions based on user skill level
  - Skip irrelevant areas based on project scope
  - Add project-specific decisions not covered here
  - Make intelligent recommendations users can correct
  </critical>
  
  ## Frontend Architecture
  
  **Framework Selection**
  Guide the user to choose a frontend framework based on their project needs. Consider factors like:
  
  - Server-side rendering requirements (SEO, initial load performance)
  - Team expertise and learning curve
  - Project complexity and timeline
  - Community support and ecosystem maturity
  
  For beginners: Suggest mainstream options like Next.js or plain React based on their needs.
  For experts: Discuss trade-offs between frameworks briefly, let them specify preferences.
  
  **Styling Strategy**
  Determine the CSS approach that aligns with their team and project:
  
  - Consider maintainability, performance, and developer experience
  - Factor in design system requirements and component reusability
  - Think about build complexity and tooling
  
  Adapt based on skill level - beginners may benefit from utility-first CSS, while teams with strong CSS expertise might prefer CSS Modules or styled-components.
  
  **State Management**
  Only explore if the project has complex client-side state requirements:
  
  - For simple apps, Context API or server state might suffice
  - For complex apps, discuss lightweight vs. comprehensive solutions
  - Consider data flow patterns and debugging needs
  
  ## Backend Strategy
  
  **Backend Architecture**
  Intelligently determine backend needs:
  
  - If it's a static site, skip backend entirely
  - For full-stack apps, consider integrated vs. separate backend
  - Factor in team structure (full-stack vs. specialized teams)
  - Consider deployment and operational complexity
  
  Make smart defaults based on frontend choice (e.g., Next.js API routes for Next.js apps).
  
  **API Design**
  Based on client needs and team expertise:
  
  - REST for simplicity and wide compatibility
  - GraphQL for complex data requirements with multiple clients
  - tRPC for type-safe full-stack TypeScript projects
  - Consider hybrid approaches when appropriate
  
  ## Data Layer
  
  **Database Selection**
  Guide based on data characteristics and requirements:
  
  - Relational for structured data with relationships
  - Document stores for flexible schemas
  - Consider managed services vs. self-hosted based on team capacity
  - Factor in existing infrastructure and expertise
  
  For beginners: Suggest managed solutions like Supabase or Firebase.
  For experts: Discuss specific database trade-offs if relevant.
  
  **Data Access Patterns**
  Determine ORM/query builder needs based on:
  
  - Type safety requirements
  - Team SQL expertise
  - Performance requirements
  - Migration and schema management needs
  
  ## Authentication & Authorization
  
  **Auth Strategy**
  Assess security requirements and implementation complexity:
  
  - For MVPs: Suggest managed auth services
  - For enterprise: Discuss compliance and customization needs
  - Consider user experience requirements (SSO, social login, etc.)
  
  Skip detailed auth discussion if it's an internal tool or public site without user accounts.
  
  ## Deployment & Operations
  
  **Hosting Platform**
  Make intelligent suggestions based on:
  
  - Framework choice (Vercel for Next.js, Netlify for static sites)
  - Budget and scale requirements
  - DevOps expertise
  - Geographic distribution needs
  
  **CI/CD Pipeline**
  Adapt to team maturity:
  
  - For small teams: Platform-provided CI/CD
  - For larger teams: Discuss comprehensive pipelines
  - Consider existing tooling and workflows
  
  ## Additional Services
  
  <intent>
  Only discuss these if relevant to the project requirements:
  - Email service (for transactional emails)
  - Payment processing (for e-commerce)
  - File storage (for user uploads)
  - Search (for content-heavy sites)
  - Caching (for performance-critical apps)
  - Monitoring (based on uptime requirements)
  
  Don't present these as a checklist - intelligently determine what's needed based on the PRD/requirements.
  </intent>
  
  ## Adaptive Guidance Examples
  
  **For a marketing website:**
  Focus on static site generation, CDN, SEO, and analytics. Skip complex backend discussions.
  
  **For a SaaS application:**
  Emphasize authentication, subscription management, multi-tenancy, and monitoring.
  
  **For an internal tool:**
  Prioritize rapid development, simple deployment, and integration with existing systems.
  
  **For an e-commerce platform:**
  Focus on payment processing, inventory management, performance, and security.
  
  ## Key Principles
  
  1. **Start with requirements**, not technology choices
  2. **Adapt to user expertise** - don't overwhelm beginners or bore experts
  3. **Make intelligent defaults** the user can override
  4. **Focus on decisions that matter** for this specific project
  5. **Document definitive choices** with specific versions
  6. **Keep rationale concise** unless explanation is needed
  
  ## Output Format
  
  Generate architecture decisions as:
  
  - **Decision**: [Specific technology with version]
  - **Brief Rationale**: [One sentence if needed]
  - **Configuration**: [Key settings if non-standard]
  
  Avoid lengthy explanations unless the user is a beginner or asks for clarification.

  <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/project-types/mobile-instructions.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Mobile Application Architecture Instructions
  
  ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
  
  <critical>
  This is a STARTING POINT for mobile app architecture decisions.
  The LLM should:
  - Understand platform requirements from the PRD (iOS, Android, or both)
  - Guide framework choice based on team expertise and project needs
  - Focus on mobile-specific concerns (offline, performance, battery)
  - Adapt complexity to project scale and team size
  - Keep decisions concrete and implementation-focused
  </critical>
  
  ## Platform Strategy
  
  **Determine the Right Approach**
  Analyze requirements to recommend:
  
  - **Native** (Swift/Kotlin): When platform-specific features and performance are critical
  - **Cross-platform** (React Native/Flutter): For faster development across platforms
  - **Hybrid** (Ionic/Capacitor): When web expertise exists and native features are minimal
  - **PWA**: For simple apps with basic device access needs
  
  Consider team expertise heavily - don't suggest Flutter to an iOS team unless there's strong justification.
  
  ## Framework and Technology Selection
  
  **Match Framework to Project Needs**
  Based on the requirements and team:
  
  - **React Native**: JavaScript teams, code sharing with web, large ecosystem
  - **Flutter**: Consistent UI across platforms, high performance animations
  - **Native**: Platform-specific UX, maximum performance, full API access
  - **.NET MAUI**: C# teams, enterprise environments
  
  For beginners: Recommend based on existing web experience.
  For experts: Focus on specific trade-offs relevant to their use case.
  
  ## Application Architecture
  
  **Architectural Pattern**
  Guide toward appropriate patterns:
  
  - **MVVM/MVP**: For testability and separation of concerns
  - **Redux/MobX**: For complex state management
  - **Clean Architecture**: For larger teams and long-term maintenance
  
  Don't over-architect simple apps - a basic MVC might suffice for simple utilities.
  
  ## Data Management
  
  **Local Storage Strategy**
  Based on data requirements:
  
  - **SQLite**: Structured data, complex queries, offline-first apps
  - **Realm**: Object database for simpler data models
  - **AsyncStorage/SharedPreferences**: Simple key-value storage
  - **Core Data**: iOS-specific with iCloud sync
  
  **Sync and Offline Strategy**
  Only if offline capability is required:
  
  - Conflict resolution approach
  - Sync triggers and frequency
  - Data compression and optimization
  
  ## API Communication
  
  **Network Layer Design**
  
  - RESTful APIs for simple CRUD operations
  - GraphQL for complex data requirements
  - WebSocket for real-time features
  - Consider bandwidth optimization for mobile networks
  
  **Security Considerations**
  
  - Certificate pinning for sensitive apps
  - Token storage in secure keychain
  - Biometric authentication integration
  
  ## UI/UX Architecture
  
  **Design System Approach**
  
  - Platform-specific (Material Design, Human Interface Guidelines)
  - Custom design system for brand consistency
  - Component library selection
  
  **Navigation Pattern**
  Based on app complexity:
  
  - Tab-based for simple apps with clear sections
  - Drawer navigation for many features
  - Stack navigation for linear flows
  - Hybrid for complex apps
  
  ## Performance Optimization
  
  **Mobile-Specific Performance**
  Focus on what matters for mobile:
  
  - App size (consider app thinning, dynamic delivery)
  - Startup time optimization
  - Memory management
  - Battery efficiency
  - Network optimization
  
  Only dive deep into performance if the PRD indicates performance-critical requirements.
  
  ## Native Features Integration
  
  **Device Capabilities**
  Based on PRD requirements, plan for:
  
  - Camera/Gallery access patterns
  - Location services and geofencing
  - Push notifications architecture
  - Biometric authentication
  - Payment integration (Apple Pay, Google Pay)
  
  Don't list all possible features - focus on what's actually needed.
  
  ## Testing Strategy
  
  **Mobile Testing Approach**
  
  - Unit testing for business logic
  - UI testing for critical flows
  - Device testing matrix (OS versions, screen sizes)
  - Beta testing distribution (TestFlight, Play Console)
  
  Scale testing complexity to project risk and team size.
  
  ## Distribution and Updates

  ## Key Principles
  
  1. **Platform conventions matter** - Don't fight the platform
  2. **Performance is felt immediately** - Mobile users are sensitive to lag
  3. **Offline-first when appropriate** - But don't over-engineer
  4. **Test on real devices** - Simulators hide real issues
  5. **Plan for app store review** - Build in buffer time
  
  ## Output Format
  
  Document decisions as:
  
  - **Technology**: [Specific framework/library with version]
  - **Justification**: [Why this fits the requirements]
  - **Platform-specific notes**: [iOS/Android differences if applicable]
  
  Keep mobile-specific considerations prominent in the architecture document.

  <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/project-types/game-instructions.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Game Development Architecture Instructions
  
  ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
  
  <critical>
  This is a STARTING POINT for game project architecture decisions.
  The LLM should:
  - FIRST understand the game type from the GDD (RPG, puzzle, shooter, etc.)
  - Check if engine preference is already mentioned in GDD or by user
  - Adapt architecture heavily based on game type and complexity
  - Consider that each game type has VASTLY different needs
  - Keep beginner-friendly suggestions for those without preferences
  </critical>
  
  ## Engine Selection Strategy
  
  **Intelligent Engine Guidance**
  
  First, check if the user has already indicated an engine preference in the GDD or conversation.
  
  If no engine specified, ask directly:
  "Do you have a game engine preference? If you're unsure, I can suggest options based on your [game type] and team experience."
  
  **For Beginners Without Preference:**
  Based on game type, suggest the most approachable option:
  
  - **2D Games**: Godot (free, beginner-friendly) or GameMaker (visual scripting)
  - **3D Games**: Unity (huge community, learning resources)
  - **Web Games**: Phaser (JavaScript) or Godot (exports to web)
  - **Visual Novels**: Ren'Py (purpose-built) or Twine (for text-based)
  - **Mobile Focus**: Unity or Godot (both export well to mobile)
  
  Always explain: "I'm suggesting [Engine] because it's beginner-friendly for [game type] and has [specific advantages]. Other viable options include [alternatives]."
  
  **For Experienced Teams:**
  Let them state their preference, then ensure architecture aligns with engine capabilities.
  
  ## Game Type Adaptive Architecture
  
  <critical>
  The architecture MUST adapt to the game type identified in the GDD.
  Load the specific game type considerations and merge with general guidance.

  <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/project-types/backend-instructions.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Backend/API Service Architecture Instructions
  
  ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
  
  <critical>
  This is a STARTING POINT for backend/API architecture decisions.
  The LLM should:
  - Analyze the PRD to understand data flows, performance needs, and integrations
  - Guide decisions based on scale, team size, and operational complexity
  - Focus only on relevant architectural areas
  - Make intelligent recommendations that align with project requirements
  - Keep explanations concise and decision-focused
  </critical>
  
  ## Service Architecture Pattern
  
  **Determine the Right Architecture**
  Based on the requirements, guide toward the appropriate pattern:
  
  - **Monolith**: For most projects starting out, single deployment, simple operations
  - **Microservices**: Only when there's clear domain separation, large teams, or specific scaling needs
  - **Serverless**: For event-driven workloads, variable traffic, or minimal operations
  - **Modular Monolith**: Best of both worlds for growing projects
  
  Don't default to microservices - most projects benefit from starting simple.
  
  ## Language and Framework Selection
  
  **Choose Based on Context**
  Consider these factors intelligently:
  
  - Team expertise (use what the team knows unless there's a compelling reason)
  - Performance requirements (Go/Rust for high performance, Python/Node for rapid development)
  - Ecosystem needs (Python for ML/data, Node for full-stack JS, Java for enterprise)
  - Hiring pool and long-term maintenance
  
  For beginners: Suggest mainstream options with good documentation.
  For experts: Let them specify preferences, discuss specific trade-offs only if asked.
  
  ## API Design Philosophy
  
  **Match API Style to Client Needs**
  
  - REST: Default for public APIs, simple CRUD, wide compatibility
  - GraphQL: Multiple clients with different data needs, complex relationships
  - gRPC: Service-to-service communication, high performance binary protocols
  - WebSocket/SSE: Real-time requirements
  
  Don't ask about API paradigm if it's obvious from requirements (e.g., real-time chat needs WebSocket).
  
  ## Data Architecture
  
  **Database Decisions Based on Data Characteristics**
  Analyze the data requirements to suggest:
  
  - **Relational** (PostgreSQL/MySQL): Structured data, ACID requirements, complex queries
  - **Document** (MongoDB): Flexible schemas, hierarchical data, rapid prototyping
  - **Key-Value** (Redis/DynamoDB): Caching, sessions, simple lookups
  - **Time-series**: IoT, metrics, event data
  - **Graph**: Social networks, recommendation engines
  
  Consider polyglot persistence only for clear, distinct use cases.
  
  **Data Access Layer**
  
  - ORMs for developer productivity and type safety
  - Query builders for flexibility with some safety
  - Raw SQL only when performance is critical
  
  Match to team expertise and project complexity.
  
  ## Security and Authentication
  
  **Security Appropriate to Risk**
  
  - Internal tools: Simple API keys might suffice
  - B2C applications: Managed auth services (Auth0, Firebase Auth)
  - B2B/Enterprise: SAML, SSO, advanced RBAC
  - Financial/Healthcare: Compliance-driven requirements
  
  Don't over-engineer security for prototypes, don't under-engineer for production.
  
  ## Messaging and Events
  
  **Only If Required by the Architecture**
  Determine if async processing is actually needed:
  
  - Message queues for decoupling, reliability, buffering
  - Event streaming for event sourcing, real-time analytics
  - Pub/sub for fan-out scenarios
  
  Skip this entirely for simple request-response APIs.
  
  ## Operational Considerations
  
  **Observability Based on Criticality**
  
  - Development: Basic logging might suffice
  - Production: Structured logging, metrics, tracing
  - Mission-critical: Full observability stack
  
  **Scaling Strategy**
  
  - Start with vertical scaling (simpler)
  - Plan for horizontal scaling if needed
  - Consider auto-scaling for variable loads
  
  ## Performance Requirements
  
  **Right-Size Performance Decisions**
  
  - Don't optimize prematurely
  - Identify actual bottlenecks from requirements
  - Consider caching strategically, not everywhere
  - Database optimization before adding complexity
  
  ## Integration Patterns
  
  **External Service Integration**
  Based on the PRD's integration requirements:
  
  - Circuit breakers for resilience
  - Rate limiting for API consumption
  - Webhook patterns for event reception
  - SDK vs. API direct calls
  
  ## Deployment Strategy
  
  **Match Deployment to Team Capability**
  
  - Small teams: Managed platforms (Heroku, Railway, Fly.io)
  - DevOps teams: Kubernetes, cloud-native
  - Enterprise: Consider existing infrastructure
  
  **CI/CD Complexity**
  
  - Start simple: Platform auto-deploy
  - Add complexity as needed: testing stages, approvals, rollback
  
  ## Adaptive Guidance Examples
  
  **For a REST API serving a mobile app:**
  Focus on response times, offline support, versioning, and push notifications.
  
  **For a data processing pipeline:**
  Emphasize batch vs. stream processing, data validation, error handling, and monitoring.
  
  **For a microservices migration:**
  Discuss service boundaries, data consistency, service discovery, and distributed tracing.
  
  **For an enterprise integration:**
  Focus on security, compliance, audit logging, and existing system compatibility.
  
  ## Key Principles
  
  1. **Start simple, evolve as needed** - Don't build for imaginary scale
  2. **Use boring technology** - Proven solutions over cutting edge
  3. **Optimize for your constraint** - Development speed, performance, or operations
  4. **Make reversible decisions** - Avoid early lock-in
  5. **Document the "why"** - But keep it brief
  
  ## Output Format
  
  Structure decisions as:
  
  - **Choice**: [Specific technology with version]
  - **Rationale**: [One sentence why this fits the requirements]
  - **Trade-off**: [What we're optimizing for vs. what we're accepting]
  
  Keep technical decisions definitive and version-specific for LLM consumption.

  The status file tracks progress across all workflows and stores project configuration.
  
  Note: This workflow is typically invoked automatically by solution-architecture, or manually for JIT epic tech specs.
  
  Options:
  1. Run workflow-status first to create the status file (recommended)
  2. Continue in standalone mode (no progress tracking)
  3. Exit

  **Epic Details:**
  - Epic ID: {{epic_id}}
  - Epic Title: {{epic_title}}
  - Tech Spec File: {{default_output_file}}
  
  **Status file updated:**
  - Current step: tech-spec (Epic {{epic_id}}) ✓
  - Progress: {{new_progress_percentage}}%
  
  **Note:** This is a JIT (Just-In-Time) workflow.
  - Run again for other epics that need detailed tech specs
  - Or proceed to Phase 4 (Implementation) if all tech specs are complete
  
  **Next Steps:**
  1. If more epics need tech specs: Run tech-spec again with different epic_id
  2. If all tech specs complete: Proceed to Phase 4 implementation
  3. Check status anytime with: `workflow-status`

  - Epic Title: {{epic_title}}
  - Tech Spec File: {{default_output_file}}
  
  Note: Running in standalone mode (no status file).
  
  To track progress across workflows, run `workflow-status` first.
