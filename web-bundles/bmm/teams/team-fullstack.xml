    This context guide provides project-specific considerations for brainstorming sessions focused on software and product development.
    
    ## Session Focus Areas
    
    When brainstorming for projects, consider exploring:
    
    - **User Problems and Pain Points** - What challenges do users face?
    - **Feature Ideas and Capabilities** - What could the product do?
    - **Technical Approaches** - How might we build it?
    - **User Experience** - How will users interact with it?
    - **Business Model and Value** - How does it create value?
    - **Market Differentiation** - What makes it unique?
    - **Technical Risks and Challenges** - What could go wrong?
    - **Success Metrics** - How will we measure success?
    
    ## Integration with Project Workflow
    
    Brainstorming sessions typically feed into:
    
    - **Product Briefs** - Initial product vision and strategy
    - **PRDs** - Detailed requirements documents
    - **Technical Specifications** - Architecture and implementation plans
    - **Research Activities** - Areas requiring further investigation

    <critical>
    REMEMBER: YOU ARE A MASTER Brainstorming Creative FACILITATOR: Guide the user as a facilitator to generate their own ideas through questions, prompts, and examples. Don't brainstorm for them unless they explicitly request it.
    </critical>
    
    <facilitation-principles>
      - Ask, don't tell - Use questions to draw out ideas
      - Build, don't judge - Use "Yes, and..." never "No, but..."
      - Quantity over quality - Aim for 100 ideas in 60 minutes
      - Defer judgment - Evaluation comes after generation
      - Stay curious - Show genuine interest in their ideas
    </facilitation-principles>
    
    For each technique:
    
    1. **Introduce the technique** - Use the description from CSV to explain how it works
    2. **Provide the first prompt** - Use facilitation_prompts from CSV (pipe-separated prompts)
       - Parse facilitation_prompts field and select appropriate prompts
       - These are your conversation starters and follow-ups
    3. **Wait for their response** - Let them generate ideas
    4. **Build on their ideas** - Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "What if we also..."
    5. **Ask follow-up questions** - "Tell me more about...", "How would that work?", "What else?"
    6. **Monitor energy** - Check: "How are you feeling about this {session / technique / progress}?"
       - If energy is high → Keep pushing with current technique
       - If energy is low → "Should we try a different angle or take a quick break?"
    7. **Keep momentum** - Celebrate: "Great! You've generated [X] ideas so far!"
    8. **Document everything** - Capture all ideas for the final report
    
    <example>
    Example facilitation flow for any technique:
    
    1. Introduce: "Let's try [technique_name]. [Adapt description from CSV to their context]."
    
    2. First Prompt: Pull first facilitation_prompt from {brain_techniques} and adapt to their topic
       - CSV: "What if we had unlimited resources?"
       - Adapted: "What if you had unlimited resources for [their_topic]?"
    
    3. Build on Response: Use "Yes, and..." or "That reminds me..." or "Building on that..."
    
    4. Next Prompt: Pull next facilitation_prompt when ready to advance
    
    5. Monitor Energy: After 10-15 minutes, check if they want to continue or switch
    
    The CSV provides the prompts - your role is to facilitate naturally in your unique voice.
    </example>
    
    Continue engaging with the technique until the user indicates they want to:
    
    - Switch to a different technique ("Ready for a different approach?")
    - Apply current ideas to a new technique
    - Move to the convergent phase
    - End the session
    
    <energy-checkpoint>
      After 15-20 minutes with a technique, check: "Should we continue with this technique or try something new?"

    When ready to consolidate:
    
    Guide the user through categorizing their ideas:
    
    1. **Review all generated ideas** - Display everything captured so far
    2. **Identify patterns** - "I notice several ideas about X... and others about Y..."
    3. **Group into categories** - Work with user to organize ideas within and across techniques
    
    Ask: "Looking at all these ideas, which ones feel like:

    <ask>Of all the ideas we've generated, which 3 feel most important to pursue?</ask>
    
    For each priority:
    
    1. Ask why this is a priority
    2. Identify concrete next steps
    3. Determine resource needs
    4. Set realistic timeline

    ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
    
    <critical>
    This is a STARTING POINT for web project architecture decisions.
    The LLM should:
    - Understand the project requirements deeply before making suggestions
    - Adapt questions based on user skill level
    - Skip irrelevant areas based on project scope
    - Add project-specific decisions not covered here
    - Make intelligent recommendations users can correct
    </critical>
    
    ## Frontend Architecture
    
    **Framework Selection**
    Guide the user to choose a frontend framework based on their project needs. Consider factors like:
    
    - Server-side rendering requirements (SEO, initial load performance)
    - Team expertise and learning curve
    - Project complexity and timeline
    - Community support and ecosystem maturity
    
    For beginners: Suggest mainstream options like Next.js or plain React based on their needs.
    For experts: Discuss trade-offs between frameworks briefly, let them specify preferences.
    
    **Styling Strategy**
    Determine the CSS approach that aligns with their team and project:
    
    - Consider maintainability, performance, and developer experience
    - Factor in design system requirements and component reusability
    - Think about build complexity and tooling
    
    Adapt based on skill level - beginners may benefit from utility-first CSS, while teams with strong CSS expertise might prefer CSS Modules or styled-components.
    
    **State Management**
    Only explore if the project has complex client-side state requirements:
    
    - For simple apps, Context API or server state might suffice
    - For complex apps, discuss lightweight vs. comprehensive solutions
    - Consider data flow patterns and debugging needs
    
    ## Backend Strategy
    
    **Backend Architecture**
    Intelligently determine backend needs:
    
    - If it's a static site, skip backend entirely
    - For full-stack apps, consider integrated vs. separate backend
    - Factor in team structure (full-stack vs. specialized teams)
    - Consider deployment and operational complexity
    
    Make smart defaults based on frontend choice (e.g., Next.js API routes for Next.js apps).
    
    **API Design**
    Based on client needs and team expertise:
    
    - REST for simplicity and wide compatibility
    - GraphQL for complex data requirements with multiple clients
    - tRPC for type-safe full-stack TypeScript projects
    - Consider hybrid approaches when appropriate
    
    ## Data Layer
    
    **Database Selection**
    Guide based on data characteristics and requirements:
    
    - Relational for structured data with relationships
    - Document stores for flexible schemas
    - Consider managed services vs. self-hosted based on team capacity
    - Factor in existing infrastructure and expertise
    
    For beginners: Suggest managed solutions like Supabase or Firebase.
    For experts: Discuss specific database trade-offs if relevant.
    
    **Data Access Patterns**
    Determine ORM/query builder needs based on:
    
    - Type safety requirements
    - Team SQL expertise
    - Performance requirements
    - Migration and schema management needs
    
    ## Authentication & Authorization
    
    **Auth Strategy**
    Assess security requirements and implementation complexity:
    
    - For MVPs: Suggest managed auth services
    - For enterprise: Discuss compliance and customization needs
    - Consider user experience requirements (SSO, social login, etc.)
    
    Skip detailed auth discussion if it's an internal tool or public site without user accounts.
    
    ## Deployment & Operations
    
    **Hosting Platform**
    Make intelligent suggestions based on:
    
    - Framework choice (Vercel for Next.js, Netlify for static sites)
    - Budget and scale requirements
    - DevOps expertise
    - Geographic distribution needs
    
    **CI/CD Pipeline**
    Adapt to team maturity:
    
    - For small teams: Platform-provided CI/CD
    - For larger teams: Discuss comprehensive pipelines
    - Consider existing tooling and workflows
    
    ## Additional Services
    
    <intent>
    Only discuss these if relevant to the project requirements:
    - Email service (for transactional emails)
    - Payment processing (for e-commerce)
    - File storage (for user uploads)
    - Search (for content-heavy sites)
    - Caching (for performance-critical apps)
    - Monitoring (based on uptime requirements)
    
    Don't present these as a checklist - intelligently determine what's needed based on the PRD/requirements.
    </intent>
    
    ## Adaptive Guidance Examples
    
    **For a marketing website:**
    Focus on static site generation, CDN, SEO, and analytics. Skip complex backend discussions.
    
    **For a SaaS application:**
    Emphasize authentication, subscription management, multi-tenancy, and monitoring.
    
    **For an internal tool:**
    Prioritize rapid development, simple deployment, and integration with existing systems.
    
    **For an e-commerce platform:**
    Focus on payment processing, inventory management, performance, and security.
    
    ## Key Principles
    
    1. **Start with requirements**, not technology choices
    2. **Adapt to user expertise** - don't overwhelm beginners or bore experts
    3. **Make intelligent defaults** the user can override
    4. **Focus on decisions that matter** for this specific project
    5. **Document definitive choices** with specific versions
    6. **Keep rationale concise** unless explanation is needed
    
    ## Output Format
    
    Generate architecture decisions as:
    
    - **Decision**: [Specific technology with version]
    - **Brief Rationale**: [One sentence if needed]
    - **Configuration**: [Key settings if non-standard]
    
    Avoid lengthy explanations unless the user is a beginner or asks for clarification.

    <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/project-types/mobile-instructions.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Mobile Application Architecture Instructions
    
    ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
    
    <critical>
    This is a STARTING POINT for mobile app architecture decisions.
    The LLM should:
    - Understand platform requirements from the PRD (iOS, Android, or both)
    - Guide framework choice based on team expertise and project needs
    - Focus on mobile-specific concerns (offline, performance, battery)
    - Adapt complexity to project scale and team size
    - Keep decisions concrete and implementation-focused
    </critical>
    
    ## Platform Strategy
    
    **Determine the Right Approach**
    Analyze requirements to recommend:
    
    - **Native** (Swift/Kotlin): When platform-specific features and performance are critical
    - **Cross-platform** (React Native/Flutter): For faster development across platforms
    - **Hybrid** (Ionic/Capacitor): When web expertise exists and native features are minimal
    - **PWA**: For simple apps with basic device access needs
    
    Consider team expertise heavily - don't suggest Flutter to an iOS team unless there's strong justification.
    
    ## Framework and Technology Selection
    
    **Match Framework to Project Needs**
    Based on the requirements and team:
    
    - **React Native**: JavaScript teams, code sharing with web, large ecosystem
    - **Flutter**: Consistent UI across platforms, high performance animations
    - **Native**: Platform-specific UX, maximum performance, full API access
    - **.NET MAUI**: C# teams, enterprise environments

    - A/B testing and feature flags
    - Crash reporting and analytics
    
    **Compliance and Guidelines**
    
    - App Store/Play Store guidelines
    - Privacy requirements (ATT, data collection)
    - Content ratings and age restrictions
    
    ## Adaptive Guidance Examples
    
    **For a Social Media App:**
    Focus on real-time updates, media handling, offline caching, and push notification strategy.
    
    **For an Enterprise App:**
    Emphasize security, MDM integration, SSO, and offline data sync.
    
    **For a Gaming App:**
    Focus on performance, graphics framework, monetization, and social features.
    
    **For a Utility App:**
    Keep it simple - basic UI, minimal backend, focus on core functionality.
    
    ## Key Principles
    
    1. **Platform conventions matter** - Don't fight the platform
    2. **Performance is felt immediately** - Mobile users are sensitive to lag
    3. **Offline-first when appropriate** - But don't over-engineer
    4. **Test on real devices** - Simulators hide real issues
    5. **Plan for app store review** - Build in buffer time
    
    ## Output Format
    
    Document decisions as:
    
    - **Technology**: [Specific framework/library with version]
    - **Justification**: [Why this fits the requirements]
    - **Platform-specific notes**: [iOS/Android differences if applicable]
    
    Keep mobile-specific considerations prominent in the architecture document.

    <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/project-types/game-instructions.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Game Development Architecture Instructions
    
    ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
    
    <critical>
    This is a STARTING POINT for game project architecture decisions.
    The LLM should:
    - FIRST understand the game type from the GDD (RPG, puzzle, shooter, etc.)
    - Check if engine preference is already mentioned in GDD or by user
    - Adapt architecture heavily based on game type and complexity
    - Consider that each game type has VASTLY different needs
    - Keep beginner-friendly suggestions for those without preferences
    </critical>
    
    ## Engine Selection Strategy
    
    **Intelligent Engine Guidance**
    
    First, check if the user has already indicated an engine preference in the GDD or conversation.
    
    If no engine specified, ask directly:
    "Do you have a game engine preference? If you're unsure, I can suggest options based on your [game type] and team experience."
    
    **For Beginners Without Preference:**
    Based on game type, suggest the most approachable option:
    
    - **2D Games**: Godot (free, beginner-friendly) or GameMaker (visual scripting)
    - **3D Games**: Unity (huge community, learning resources)
    - **Web Games**: Phaser (JavaScript) or Godot (exports to web)
    - **Visual Novels**: Ren'Py (purpose-built) or Twine (for text-based)
    - **Mobile Focus**: Unity or Godot (both export well to mobile)
    
    Always explain: "I'm suggesting [Engine] because it's beginner-friendly for [game type] and has [specific advantages]. Other viable options include [alternatives]."
    
    **For Experienced Teams:**
    Let them state their preference, then ensure architecture aligns with engine capabilities.
    
    ## Game Type Adaptive Architecture
    
    <critical>
    The architecture MUST adapt to the game type identified in the GDD.

       - Simple (jam game, prototype)
       - Medium (indie release)
       - Complex (commercial, multiplayer)
    3. **Check Engine Preference** or guide selection
    4. **Load Game-Type Specific Needs**
    5. **Merge with Platform Requirements**
    6. **Output Focused Architecture**
    
    ## Key Principles
    
    1. **Game type drives architecture** - RPG != Puzzle != Shooter
    2. **Don't over-engineer** - Match complexity to scope
    3. **Prototype the core loop first** - Architecture serves gameplay
    4. **Engine choice affects everything** - Align architecture with engine
    5. **Performance requirements vary** - Mobile puzzle != PC MMO
    
    ## Output Format

    <file id="bmad/bmm/workflows/3-solutioning/project-types/backend-instructions.md" type="md"><![CDATA[# Backend/API Service Architecture Instructions
    
    ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
    
    <critical>
    This is a STARTING POINT for backend/API architecture decisions.
    The LLM should:
    - Analyze the PRD to understand data flows, performance needs, and integrations
    - Guide decisions based on scale, team size, and operational complexity
    - Focus only on relevant architectural areas
    - Make intelligent recommendations that align with project requirements
    - Keep explanations concise and decision-focused
    </critical>
    
    ## Service Architecture Pattern
    
    **Determine the Right Architecture**
    Based on the requirements, guide toward the appropriate pattern:
    
    - **Monolith**: For most projects starting out, single deployment, simple operations
    - **Microservices**: Only when there's clear domain separation, large teams, or specific scaling needs
    - **Serverless**: For event-driven workloads, variable traffic, or minimal operations
    - **Modular Monolith**: Best of both worlds for growing projects
    
    Don't default to microservices - most projects benefit from starting simple.
    
    ## Language and Framework Selection
    
    **Choose Based on Context**
    Consider these factors intelligently:
    
    - Team expertise (use what the team knows unless there's a compelling reason)
    - Performance requirements (Go/Rust for high performance, Python/Node for rapid development)
    - Ecosystem needs (Python for ML/data, Node for full-stack JS, Java for enterprise)
    - Hiring pool and long-term maintenance
    
    For beginners: Suggest mainstream options with good documentation.
    For experts: Let them specify preferences, discuss specific trade-offs only if asked.
    
    ## API Design Philosophy
    
    **Match API Style to Client Needs**
    
    - REST: Default for public APIs, simple CRUD, wide compatibility
    - GraphQL: Multiple clients with different data needs, complex relationships
    - gRPC: Service-to-service communication, high performance binary protocols
    - WebSocket/SSE: Real-time requirements
    
    Don't ask about API paradigm if it's obvious from requirements (e.g., real-time chat needs WebSocket).
    
    ## Data Architecture
    
    **Database Decisions Based on Data Characteristics**
    Analyze the data requirements to suggest:
    
    - **Relational** (PostgreSQL/MySQL): Structured data, ACID requirements, complex queries
    - **Document** (MongoDB): Flexible schemas, hierarchical data, rapid prototyping
    - **Key-Value** (Redis/DynamoDB): Caching, sessions, simple lookups
    - **Time-series**: IoT, metrics, event data
    - **Graph**: Social networks, recommendation engines
    
    Consider polyglot persistence only for clear, distinct use cases.
    
    **Data Access Layer**
    
    - ORMs for developer productivity and type safety
    - Query builders for flexibility with some safety
    - Raw SQL only when performance is critical
    
    Match to team expertise and project complexity.
    
    ## Security and Authentication
    
    **Security Appropriate to Risk**
    
    - Internal tools: Simple API keys might suffice
    - B2C applications: Managed auth services (Auth0, Firebase Auth)
    - B2B/Enterprise: SAML, SSO, advanced RBAC
    - Financial/Healthcare: Compliance-driven requirements
    
    Don't over-engineer security for prototypes, don't under-engineer for production.
    
    ## Messaging and Events
    
    **Only If Required by the Architecture**
    Determine if async processing is actually needed:
    
    - Message queues for decoupling, reliability, buffering
    - Event streaming for event sourcing, real-time analytics
    - Pub/sub for fan-out scenarios
    
    Skip this entirely for simple request-response APIs.
    
    ## Operational Considerations
    
    **Observability Based on Criticality**
    
    - Development: Basic logging might suffice
    - Production: Structured logging, metrics, tracing
    - Mission-critical: Full observability stack
    
    **Scaling Strategy**
    
    - Start with vertical scaling (simpler)
    - Plan for horizontal scaling if needed
    - Consider auto-scaling for variable loads
    
    ## Performance Requirements
    
    **Right-Size Performance Decisions**
    
    - Don't optimize prematurely
    - Identify actual bottlenecks from requirements
    - Consider caching strategically, not everywhere
    - Database optimization before adding complexity
    
    ## Integration Patterns
    
    **External Service Integration**
    Based on the PRD's integration requirements:
    
    - Circuit breakers for resilience
    - Rate limiting for API consumption
    - Webhook patterns for event reception
    - SDK vs. API direct calls
    
    ## Deployment Strategy
    
    **Match Deployment to Team Capability**
    
    - Small teams: Managed platforms (Heroku, Railway, Fly.io)
    - DevOps teams: Kubernetes, cloud-native
    - Enterprise: Consider existing infrastructure
    
    **CI/CD Complexity**
    
    - Start simple: Platform auto-deploy
    - Add complexity as needed: testing stages, approvals, rollback
    
    ## Adaptive Guidance Examples
    
    **For a REST API serving a mobile app:**
    Focus on response times, offline support, versioning, and push notifications.
    
    **For a data processing pipeline:**
    Emphasize batch vs. stream processing, data validation, error handling, and monitoring.
    
    **For a microservices migration:**
    Discuss service boundaries, data consistency, service discovery, and distributed tracing.
    
    **For an enterprise integration:**
    Focus on security, compliance, audit logging, and existing system compatibility.
    
    ## Key Principles
    
    1. **Start simple, evolve as needed** - Don't build for imaginary scale
    2. **Use boring technology** - Proven solutions over cutting edge
    3. **Optimize for your constraint** - Development speed, performance, or operations
    4. **Make reversible decisions** - Avoid early lock-in
    5. **Document the "why"** - But keep it brief
    
    ## Output Format
    
    Structure decisions as:
    
    - **Choice**: [Specific technology with version]
    - **Rationale**: [One sentence why this fits the requirements]
    - **Trade-off**: [What we're optimizing for vs. what we're accepting]
    
    Keep technical decisions definitive and version-specific for LLM consumption.

    ## Intent-Based Technical Decision Guidance
    
    <critical>
    This is a STARTING POINT for infrastructure and DevOps architecture decisions.
    The LLM should:
    - Understand scale, reliability, and compliance requirements
    - Guide cloud vs. on-premise vs. hybrid decisions
    - Focus on automation and infrastructure as code
    - Consider team size and DevOps maturity
    - Balance complexity with operational overhead
    </critical>
    
    ## Cloud Strategy
    
    **Platform Selection**
    Based on requirements and constraints:
    
    - **Public Cloud**: AWS, GCP, Azure for scalability
    - **Private Cloud**: OpenStack, VMware for control
    - **Hybrid**: Mix of public and on-premise
    - **Multi-cloud**: Avoid vendor lock-in
    - **On-premise**: Regulatory or latency requirements
    
    Consider existing contracts, team expertise, and geographic needs.
    
    ## Infrastructure as Code
    
    **IaC Approach**
    Based on team and complexity:
    
    - **Terraform**: Cloud-agnostic, declarative
    - **CloudFormation/ARM/GCP Deployment Manager**: Cloud-native
    - **Pulumi/CDK**: Programmatic infrastructure
    - **Ansible/Chef/Puppet**: Configuration management
    - **GitOps**: Flux, ArgoCD for Kubernetes
    
    Start with declarative approaches unless programmatic benefits are clear.
    
    ## Container Strategy
    
    **Containerization Approach**
    
    - **Docker**: Standard for containerization
    - **Kubernetes**: For complex orchestration needs
    - **ECS/Cloud Run**: Managed container services
    - **Docker Compose/Swarm**: Simple orchestration
    - **Serverless**: Skip containers entirely
    
    Don't use Kubernetes for simple applications - complexity has a cost.
    
    ## CI/CD Architecture
    
    **Pipeline Design**
    
    - Source control strategy (GitFlow, GitHub Flow, trunk-based)
    - Build automation and artifact management
    - Testing stages (unit, integration, e2e)
    - Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary, rolling)
    - Environment promotion process
    
    Match complexity to release frequency and risk tolerance.
    
    ## Monitoring and Observability
    
    **Observability Stack**
    Based on scale and requirements:
    
    - **Metrics**: Prometheus, CloudWatch, Datadog
    - **Logging**: ELK, Loki, CloudWatch Logs
    - **Tracing**: Jaeger, X-Ray, Datadog APM
    - **Synthetic Monitoring**: Pingdom, New Relic
    - **Incident Management**: PagerDuty, Opsgenie
    
    Build observability appropriate to SLA requirements.
    
    ## Security Architecture
    
    **Security Layers**
    
    - Network security (VPC, security groups, NACLs)
    - Identity and access management
    - Secrets management (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
    - Vulnerability scanning
    - Compliance automation
    
    Security must be automated and auditable.
    
    ## Backup and Disaster Recovery
    
    **Resilience Strategy**
    
    - Backup frequency and retention
    - RTO/RPO requirements
    - Multi-region/multi-AZ design
    - Disaster recovery testing
    - Data replication strategy
    
    Design for your actual recovery requirements, not theoretical disasters.
    
    ## Network Architecture
    
    **Network Design**
    
    - VPC/network topology
    - Load balancing strategy
    - CDN implementation
    - Service mesh (if microservices)
    - Zero trust networking
    
    Keep networking as simple as possible while meeting requirements.
    
    ## Cost Optimization
    
    **Cost Management**
    
    - Resource right-sizing
    - Reserved instances/savings plans
    - Spot instances for appropriate workloads
    - Auto-scaling policies
    - Cost monitoring and alerts
    
    Build cost awareness into the architecture.
    
    ## Database Operations
    
    **Data Layer Management**
    
    - Managed vs. self-hosted databases
    - Backup and restore procedures
    - Read replica configuration
    - Connection pooling
    - Performance monitoring
    
    ## Service Mesh and API Gateway
    
    **API Management** (if applicable)
    
    - API Gateway for external APIs
    - Service mesh for internal communication
    - Rate limiting and throttling
    - Authentication and authorization
    - API versioning strategy
    
    ## Development Environments
    
    **Environment Strategy**
    
    - Local development setup
    - Development/staging/production parity
    - Environment provisioning automation
    - Data anonymization for non-production
    
    ## Compliance and Governance
    
    **Regulatory Requirements**
    
    - Compliance frameworks (SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI DSS)
    - Audit logging and retention
    - Change management process
    - Access control and segregation of duties
    
    Build compliance in, don't bolt it on.
    
    ## Adaptive Guidance Examples
    
    **For a Startup MVP:**
    Focus on managed services, simple CI/CD, and basic monitoring.
    
    **For Enterprise Migration:**
    Emphasize hybrid cloud, phased migration, and compliance requirements.
    
    **For High-Traffic Service:**
    Focus on auto-scaling, CDN, caching layers, and performance monitoring.
    
    **For Regulated Industry:**
    Emphasize compliance automation, audit trails, and data residency.
    
    ## Key Principles
    
    1. **Automate everything** - Manual processes don't scale
    2. **Design for failure** - Everything fails eventually
    3. **Secure by default** - Security is not optional
    4. **Monitor proactively** - Don't wait for users to report issues
    5. **Document as code** - Infrastructure documentation gets stale
    
    ## Output Format
    
    Document as:
    
    - **Platform**: [Cloud/on-premise choice]
    - **IaC Tool**: [Primary infrastructure tool]
    - **Container/Orchestration**: [If applicable]
    - **CI/CD**: [Pipeline tools and strategy]
    - **Monitoring**: [Observability stack]
    
    Focus on automation and operational excellence.

    **Epic Expansion Process:**
    
    1. **Expanded Goal** (2-3 sentences)
       - Describe the epic's objective and value delivery
       - Explain how it builds on previous work
    
    2. **Story Breakdown**
    
       **Critical Story Requirements:**
       - **Vertical slices** - Each story delivers complete, testable functionality
       - **Sequential** - Stories must be logically ordered within epic
       - **No forward dependencies** - No story depends on work from a later story/epic
       - **AI-agent sized** - Completable in single focused session (2-4 hours)
       - **Value-focused** - Minimize pure enabler stories; integrate technical work into value delivery
    
       **Story Format:**
    
       ```

       3. [etc.]
    
       **Prerequisites:** [Any dependencies on previous stories]
       ```
    
    3. **Story Sequencing Within Epic:**
       - Start with foundational/setup work if needed
       - Build progressively toward epic goal
       - Each story should leave system in working state
       - Final stories complete the epic's value delivery

    ## Overview
    
    This document provides the detailed epic breakdown for {{project_name}}, expanding on the high-level epic list in the [PRD](./PRD.md).
    
    Each epic includes:
    
    - Expanded goal and value proposition
    - Complete story breakdown with user stories
    - Acceptance criteria for each story
    - Story sequencing and dependencies
    
    **Epic Sequencing Principles:**
    
    - Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure and initial functionality
    - Subsequent epics build progressively, each delivering significant end-to-end value
    - Stories within epics are vertically sliced and sequentially ordered
    - No forward dependencies - each story builds only on previous work

    ## Story Guidelines Reference
    
    **Story Format:**
    
    ```
    **Story [EPIC.N]: [Story Title]**
    
    As a [user type],
    I want [goal/desire],
    So that [benefit/value].

    2. [Another specific criterion]
    3. [etc.]
    
    **Prerequisites:** [Dependencies on previous stories, if any]
    ```
    
    **Story Requirements:**
    
    - **Vertical slices** - Complete, testable functionality delivery
    - **Sequential ordering** - Logical progression within epic
    - **No forward dependencies** - Only depend on previous work
    - **AI-agent sized** - Completable in 2-4 hour focused session
    - **Value-focused** - Integrate technical enablers into value-delivering stories
    
    ---
    
    **For implementation:** Use the `create-story` workflow to generate individual story implementation plans from this epic breakdown.

    **Story Title Best Practices:**
    
    - Use active, user-focused language
    - Describe WHAT is delivered, not HOW
    - Good: "Icon Migration to Internal CDN"
    - Bad: "Run curl commands to download PNGs"
    
    **Story Description Format:**
    
    - As a [role] (developer, user, admin, etc.)
    - I want [capability/change]
    - So that [benefit/value]
    
    **Acceptance Criteria:**
    
    - Extract from tech-spec "Testing Approach" section
    - Must be specific, measurable, and testable
    - Include performance criteria if specified
    
    **Tasks/Subtasks:**
    
    - Map directly to tech-spec "Implementation Guide" tasks
    - Use checkboxes for tracking
    - Reference AC numbers: (AC: #1), (AC: #2)
    - Include explicit testing subtasks
    
    **Dev Notes:**
    
    - Extract technical constraints from tech-spec
    - Include file paths from "Source Tree Structure"
    - Reference architecture patterns if applicable
    - Cite tech-spec sections for implementation details

    <critical>This generates epic and user stories for Level 1 projects after tech-spec completion</critical>

    <critical>Level 1 = coherent feature, 1-10 stories (prefer 2-3), 1 epic</critical>
    <critical>This workflow runs AFTER tech-spec.md has been completed</critical>
    <critical>Story format MUST match create-story template for compatibility with story-context and dev-story workflows</critical>
    
    <step n="1" goal="Load tech spec and extract implementation tasks">
    
    <action>Read the completed tech-spec.md file from {output_folder}/tech-spec.md</action>

    <action>Create 1 epic that represents the entire feature</action>
    <action>Epic title should be user-facing value statement</action>
    <action>Epic goal should describe why this matters to users</action>
    
    <guidelines>
    **Epic Best Practices:**
    - Title format: User-focused outcome (not implementation detail)
    - Good: "JS Library Icon Reliability"
    - Bad: "Update recommendedLibraries.ts file"
    - Scope: Clearly define what's included/excluded
    - Success criteria: Measurable outcomes that define "done"
    </guidelines>
    
    <example>
    **Epic:** JS Library Icon Reliability
    
    **Goal:** Eliminate external dependencies for JS library icons to ensure consistent, reliable display and improve application performance.
    
    **Scope:** Migrate all 14 recommended JS library icons from third-party CDN URLs (GitHub, jsDelivr) to internal static asset hosting.
    
    **Success Criteria:**
    
    - All library icons load from internal paths
    - Zero external requests for library icons
    - Icons load 50-200ms faster than baseline
    - No broken icons in production
      </example>
    
    <action>Derive epic slug from epic title (kebab-case, 2-3 words max)</action>
    <example>
    
    - "JS Library Icon Reliability" → "icon-reliability"
    - "OAuth Integration" → "oauth-integration"
    - "Admin Dashboard" → "admin-dashboard"

    <action>Analyze tech spec implementation tasks and time estimates</action>
    <action>Group related tasks into logical story boundaries</action>
    
    <guidelines>
    **Story Count Decision Matrix:**
    
    **2 Stories (preferred for most Level 1):**
    
    - Use when: Feature has clear build/verify split
    - Example: Story 1 = Build feature, Story 2 = Test and deploy
    - Typical points: 3-5 points per story
    
    **3 Stories (only if necessary):**
    
    - Use when: Feature has distinct setup, build, verify phases
    - Example: Story 1 = Setup, Story 2 = Core implementation, Story 3 = Integration and testing
    - Typical points: 2-3 points per story
    
    **Never exceed 3 stories for Level 1:**
    
    - If more needed, consider if project should be Level 2
    - Better to have longer stories (5 points) than more stories (5x 1-point stories)
      </guidelines>

    <action>Story filename format: "story-{epic_slug}-{n}.md" where n = 1, 2, or 3</action>
    
    <guidelines>
    **Story Generation Guidelines:**
    - Each story = multiple implementation tasks from tech spec
    - Story title format: User-focused deliverable (not implementation steps)
    - Include technical acceptance criteria from tech spec tasks
    - Link back to tech spec sections for implementation details
    
    **Story Point Estimation:**
    
    - 1 point = < 1 day (2-4 hours)
    - 2 points = 1-2 days
    - 3 points = 2-3 days
    - 5 points = 3-5 days
    
    **Level 1 Typical Totals:**
    
    - Total story points: 5-10 points
    - 2 stories: 3-5 points each
    - 3 stories: 2-3 points each
    - If total > 15 points, consider if this should be Level 2
    
    **Story Structure (MUST match create-story format):**
    
    - Status: Draft
    - Story: As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]
    - Acceptance Criteria: Numbered list from tech spec
    - Tasks / Subtasks: Checkboxes mapped to tech spec tasks (AC: #n references)
    - Dev Notes: Technical summary, project structure notes, references
    - Dev Agent Record: Empty sections for context workflow to populate
