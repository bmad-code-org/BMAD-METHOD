# Trend Insights Platform - BMAD Expansion Pack

> Discover what people actually want by analyzing digital footprints across the web

## Overview

The **Trend Insights Platform** expansion pack equips you with the "Internet Pipes" methodology for discovering emerging trends before they hit mainstream awareness. By analyzing billions of digital breadcrumbs (searches, social media, purchases), you can identify opportunities that traditional market research misses.
