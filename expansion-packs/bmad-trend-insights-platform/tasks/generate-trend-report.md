# Task: Generate Trend Report

## Objective

Create a comprehensive trend insights report that discovers, analyzes, and synthesizes multiple trends to provide strategic intelligence and actionable opportunities.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define Report Scope

Clarify with the user:

- **Focus Area**: Industry/category (e.g., wellness, food, tech, fashion, general)

- **Depth**: How many trends to analyze? (Recommended: 8-12 for comprehensive report)
- **Timeframe**: Current trends, emerging trends, or forecast-focused?

### Step 2: Discover Trends

Use web search to discover 8-12 trends in the specified area:

1. **Search for current trends**
   - "[category] trends 2025"
   - "what's trending in [category]"
   - "emerging [category] products"
   - "[category] consumer interests"

2. **Prioritize interesting finds**
   - Look for the unexpected and non-obvious
   - Mix of different stages: emerging, rising, mainstream
   - Variety of sub-categories within the main focus
   - Balance between practical and aspirational

3. **Gather initial data**
   - Search volume indicators
   - Social mentions
   - News coverage
   - Product availability

### Step 3: Analyze Each Trend

For each trend, research:

#### Supporting Data

### Step 4: Synthesize Insights

Look across all trends to identify:

1. **Macro Patterns**
   - What themes emerge across trends?
   - What do these trends reveal about consumer behavior?
   - What broader shifts are driving these trends?

2. **Category Clusters**
   - Group related trends together
   - Identify trend intersections
   - Find synergies between trends

3. **Strategic Opportunities**
   - Which trends have the biggest opportunity?
   - Where are the market gaps?
   - What's underserved or oversaturated?
   - Where should focus be placed?

4. **Timing Intelligence**
   - Which trends are early stage (get in now)?
   - Which are peaking (exercise caution)?
   - Which are mature (stable opportunity)?

### Step 5: Generate Comprehensive Report

Create a structured report using the `trend-report-tmpl` template:

- 💡 **Actionable recommendations**: Specific moves, not vague advice
- ⚖️ **Balanced perspective**: Opportunities AND risks

### Avoid:

- ❌ Listing obvious trends everyone knows

- ❌ Treating all trends as equally valuable

## Tips for Standout Reports

2. **Think like an operator**: What would you do with this information?
3. **Be opinionated**: Take positions on which trends matter most
4. **Connect dots**: Show relationships between trends
5. **Write for skimming**: Use clear headers, bullets, and visual indicators
6. **Update regularly**: Trends change; reports should have refresh dates
