# Task: Analyze Single Trend

## Objective

Conduct a comprehensive deep-dive analysis of a specific trend to understand what it is, why it's trending, who wants it, and how to capitalize on it.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify the Trend

Confirm with the user:

- **Trend name/topic**: What specific trend should we analyze?
- **Analysis goals**: What do they want to know? (market opportunity, content strategy, product development, investment decision)

If the user provides a vague topic, help them narrow it down to a specific trend.

### Step 2: Research Foundation

3. **Target audience**

### Step 4: Market Analysis

Assess the commercial landscape:

#### C. Business Models

### Step 5: Trend Assessment

Evaluate sustainability and opportunity:

   - Alignment: Does it fit broader macro trends?

3. **Risk Factors**
