# Task: Discover Trends

## Objective

Discover current trending topics, products, or interests across the internet using web search and pattern recognition.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Scope

Ask the user to clarify (if not already provided):

- **Category/Industry**: What area should we focus on? (e.g., health, beauty, tech, food, lifestyle, or "general")
- **Geography**: Any specific region? (default: United States/Global)
- **Time Frame**: Current trends, emerging trends, or long-term trends?
- **Use Case**: Why are they looking for trends? (business opportunity, content creation, product development, market research)

### Step 2: Research Current Trends

Use web search to discover what's trending:

1. **Search trending topics** in the specified category
   - Query patterns: "[category] trending 2025", "what's popular in [category]", "emerging [category] trends"
   - Look for: Google Trends data, trend reports, social media discussions, news articles

2. **Identify specific trend examples**
   - Find 5-10 specific trending items/topics
   - Look for evidence: search volume increases, social mentions, media coverage
   - Note: product names, brands, keywords, and hashtags

3. **Gather supporting data**
   - Search interest over time (rising, stable, declining)
   - Related searches and topics
   - Geographic distribution
   - Demographic insights (if available)

### Step 3: Pattern Analysis

Analyze the trends you've discovered:

1. **Categorize trends**
   - Micro-trends (niche, early stage)
   - Rising trends (gaining momentum)
   - Mainstream trends (widespread adoption)
   - Evergreen trends (sustained interest)

2. **Identify patterns**
   - Common themes across trends
   - Underlying needs or desires
   - Category clusters
   - Seasonal vs. permanent

3. **Assess trend quality**
   - Is it a fad or sustainable?
   - What's driving the interest?
   - Who's the target audience?
   - What problem does it solve?

### Step 4: Present Findings

Format your discoveries as:

```markdown

✅ Backed findings with search data and sources
✅ Identified patterns and insights beyond just listing trends

✅ Formatted findings in clear, scannable format

## Tips for Great Trend Discovery

- **Be specific**: "Butterfly pea tea" not just "tea trends"
- **Look for surprises**: The interesting trends are often unexpected
- **Verify across sources**: One mention isn't a trend
- **Think about "why"**: Understanding drivers helps assess sustainability
- **Stay current**: Use recent sources (2024-2025)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Listing obvious/well-known trends everyone knows about
❌ Confusing single viral moments with sustained trends
❌ Missing the "so what" - always connect to opportunity
❌ Not providing enough evidence/data to back claims
❌ Making assumptions without search validation

**Remember**: You're not just reporting what's trending - you're uncovering hidden opportunities that most people don't know about yet. That's the power of Internet Pipes! 🔍✨
