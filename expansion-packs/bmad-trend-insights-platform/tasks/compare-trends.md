# Task: Compare Trends

  - Which to focus on for content creation?
  - Which has better timing/momentum?
  - Which fits their skills/resources better?
- **Decision criteria**: What matters most? (market size, competition, timing, barriers to entry, passion/interest)

### Step 2: Research Each Trend

For each trend being compared, gather:

#### Search & Interest Metrics

- Current search volume (High/Medium/Low)
- Trend trajectory (Rising %, Stable, Declining)
- Geographic distribution
- Seasonality patterns
- Related search volume

#### Market Characteristics

- Market size/revenue potential
- Growth rate
- Stage of adoption (Emerging/Growth/Mature)

- Saturation level

#### Operational Factors

### Step 3: Create Comparison Framework

‚ùå Not considering user's specific context and goals
‚ùå Ignoring timing - early vs. late in trend lifecycle
‚ùå Being too definitive - acknowledge uncertainty
