# Task: Forecast Trend

## Objective

Project the future trajectory of a trend over the next 6-12 months, helping users understand where it's headed and time their entry or exit accordingly.

## Instructions

### Step 6: Provide Decision Framework

Based on the forecast, give clear guidance:

**If forecast is bullish**: "This trend has strong momentum and runway. Consider entering now before competition intensifies."

**If forecast is bearish**: "This trend shows signs of maturity/decline. Exercise caution or look for niche opportunities within it."

**If forecast is uncertain**: "Mixed signals. Consider small tests rather than big bets. Monitor the key variables closely."

### Step 7: Offer Follow-Up

Ask if they'd like to:

- Deep-dive into the trend (`/analyze-trend`)
- Explore niche opportunities that might be more sustainable (`/niche-explorer`)
- Compare this to alternative trends (`/compare-trends`)
- Set up a forecast review reminder

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ Historical context showing trend evolution
‚úÖ Clear identification of trend drivers and headwinds
‚úÖ Three distinct scenarios (bullish, base, bearish) with probabilities
‚úÖ Specific projections for 3, 6, and 12 months
‚úÖ Key variables to monitor identified
‚úÖ Strategic implications and timing recommendations
‚úÖ Honest assessment of forecast confidence
‚úÖ Early warning indicators provided

## Tips for Accurate Forecasting

- **Use multiple data sources**: Don't rely on a single trend indicator
- **Learn from history**: Study similar past trends
- **Identify drivers**: Understand what's pushing the trend
- **Think in scenarios**: Avoid single-point predictions
- **Quantify uncertainty**: Be honest about confidence levels
- **Update regularly**: Forecasts get stale quickly

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå Linear extrapolation (assuming current growth continues unchanged)
‚ùå Ignoring external factors (macro trends, competition, regulation)
‚ùå Overconfidence in predictions
‚ùå Not considering multiple scenarios
‚ùå Forgetting that trends don't last forever
‚ùå Missing early warning signs

**Remember**: Forecasting isn't about being right - it's about being prepared for different futures. The best forecasts help you make better decisions today, whatever tomorrow brings. üîÆüìä
