## Data Collection Best Practices

### Multi-Source Validation

Always cross-reference at least 3 independent sources:

- Search (Google Trends)
- Social (TikTok OR Instagram OR Reddit)
- Commerce (Amazon OR reviews OR sales data)

### Temporal Validation

Don't rely on single-day snapshots:

- Track trends over at least 4-8 weeks
- Note weekly/monthly patterns
- Compare year-over-year when possible

### Geographic Considerations

Trends often start regionally:

- Check US, UK, Australia separately
- Note urban vs. rural patterns
- Consider cultural context

### Demographic Awareness

Different platforms represent different demographics:

- TikTok: Gen Z, younger millennials
- Instagram: Millennials, Gen Z
- Facebook: Older millennials, Gen X, Boomers
- Reddit: Male-skewing, tech-oriented
- Pinterest: Female-skewing, planning mindset

### Document Everything

Keep a trend tracking spreadsheet:

- Trend name
- First observed date
- Data sources
- Key metrics
- Notes and observations
- Follow-up dates

## Source Credibility Assessment

**High Credibility** 🟢:

- Multiple independent sources
- Commercial activity (products being sold)
- Sustained interest over time
- Cross-demographic adoption

**Medium Credibility** 🟡:

- 1-2 sources
- Some commercial activity
- Recent emergence (2-4 months)
- Single-demographic focused

**Low Credibility** 🔴:

- Single source
- No commercial validation
- Spike without sustained interest
- Potentially manipulated metrics

## Conclusion

Effective trend discovery requires:

1. **Breadth**: Monitor multiple source types
2. **Depth**: Go deep on promising signals
3. **Consistency**: Check sources regularly
4. **Skepticism**: Validate before believing
5. **Documentation**: Track what you find

No single source tells the complete story. The magic happens when signals align across multiple independent sources - that's when you've found a real trend worth pursuing.

Happy trend hunting! 🔍
