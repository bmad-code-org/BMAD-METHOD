# Trend Validation Checklist

## Overview

This checklist helps you systematically validate whether a potential trend is real, sustainable, and represents a genuine opportunity. Use this before investing significant time or resources into pursuing a trend.

## Quick Assessment (5 Minutes)

Use this for initial filtering of potential trends:

### Minimum Viability Check

- [ ] Multiple independent people/sources mentioning this (not just one viral post)
- [ ] Trend has a clear name/description (not vague or ambiguous)
- [ ] You can find at least 3 different data sources confirming interest
- [ ] Interest appears to be growing, not declining
- [ ] There's evidence people are searching for this (Google Trends confirms)

**If ALL 5 are checked ‚Üí Proceed to full validation**
**If fewer than 5 ‚Üí Likely not worth pursuing right now**

---

## Full Validation (30-60 Minutes)

### Part 1: Demand Validation

#### Search Interest ‚úÖ

- [ ] Google Trends shows rising or sustained interest (not declining)
- [ ] Trend data spans at least 3 months (not just a spike)
- [ ] Related searches exist and are growing
- [ ] People are asking questions about it (autocomplete, "People also ask")
- [ ] Search volume is significant enough (not zero or "not enough data")

**Evidence to collect**:

- Screenshot of Google Trends graph
- List of related/rising searches
- Estimate of search volume level (high/medium/low)

---

#### Social Proof ‚úÖ

- [ ] Active conversation on at least 2 social platforms
- [ ] Hashtag or keyword shows growth (views, posts, engagement)
- [ ] Multiple types of content creators covering it (not just one niche)
- [ ] Comments/engagement indicate genuine interest (not bots)
- [ ] User-generated content exists (people creating, not just consuming)

**Evidence to collect**:

- TikTok: Hashtag view counts and growth
- Instagram: Post count and engagement rates
- Reddit: Discussion threads and upvotes
- YouTube: Video counts and view rates
- Twitter: Tweet volume and sentiment

**Red flags** üö©:

- Only one platform talking about it
- All content from the same source/brand
- Comments feel astroturfed or fake
- No organic user-generated content

---

#### Community Formation ‚úÖ

- [ ] Dedicated communities exist (subreddits, Facebook groups, Discord servers)
- [ ] People asking questions and helping each other
- [ ] Resources being created (wikis, guides, recommendations)
- [ ] Recurring members/participants (not drive-by traffic)
- [ ] Organic growth in community size

**Evidence to collect**:

**Evaluate each driver**:

| Driver Type        | Present? | Sustainable? | Notes                            |
| ------------------ | -------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Functional need    | Y/N      | Y/N          | What problem does it solve?      |
| Emotional benefit  | Y/N      | Y/N          | How does it make people feel?    |
| Social/identity    | Y/N      | Y/N          | What does it signal?             |
| Novelty            | Y/N      | Y/N          | What's new about it?             |
| Technology enabler | Y/N      | Y/N          | What tech makes it possible?     |
| Cultural shift     | Y/N      | Y/N          | What value is changing?          |
| Economic factor    | Y/N      | Y/N          | What financial aspect drives it? |

**Strong trends have 3+ sustainable drivers**

**Step 3**: Decision

- Review score and flags
- Answer final questions
- Make go/no-go decision

**Step 4**: Action

## Remember

- **Validation is not procrastination** - it's smart risk management
- **No trend is perfect** - you're looking for "good enough," not flawless
- **Trust your gut** - if something feels off despite good scores, dig deeper
- **Document everything** - future you will thank present you
- **Update regularly** - trends change, re-validate periodically

The best time to catch a trend is when validation is strong but competition is still light. Use this checklist to find that sweet spot! üéØ
