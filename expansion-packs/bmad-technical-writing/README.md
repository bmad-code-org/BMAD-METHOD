## üìö Section-Driven Development Approach (NEW in Sprint 2.6)

The section-driven approach mirrors BMad's story-driven development workflow, enabling incremental chapter writing:

**Key Concepts:**

- **Section = Story analog**: Each section is a 2-5 page deliverable unit with clear acceptance criteria
- **Incremental progress**: Track "Chapter 3: 5 of 8 sections complete" like story completion
- **Parallel development**: Multiple sections can be developed simultaneously if dependencies allow
- **Work-in-progress reviews**: Review sections as they're completed, not waiting for full chapter
- **Story-driven iteration**: Write ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Polish cycle at section level

**Typical Chapter Breakdown:**

- 20-page chapter = 5-8 sections
- Small section: 2-3 pages, 1 concept, 1 code example (3 story points)
- Medium section: 3-4 pages, 1-2 concepts, 2 code examples (5 story points)
- Large section: 4-5 pages, 2-3 concepts, 2-3 code examples (8 story points)

**Workflow Mapping:**

| BMad Software Dev | Book Writing (Section-Driven)                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| PRD Creation      | book-planning-workflow ‚Üí book outline            |
| Architecture      | chapter-planning ‚Üí chapter outline               |
| Epic Breakdown    | section-planning-workflow ‚Üí section list         |
| Story Development | section-development-workflow ‚Üí completed section |
| Sprint Review     | chapter-assembly-workflow ‚Üí integrated chapter   |
| Release           | publisher-submission ‚Üí published chapter         |

**When to Use Section-Driven:**

- Chapters 15+ pages (too large for single sitting)
- Want incremental progress tracking
- Need parallel development capability
- Prefer iterative story-driven approach
- Want to review work before full chapter complete

**When to Use Traditional:**

- Short chapters (<10-12 pages)
- Simple reference sections
- Author prefers writing full chapter at once
- Chapter already partially written

## üöß Roadmap

**Sprint 3** (Planned):

- API Documenter agent
- Screenshot Specialist agent
- Additional publisher-specific agents
- Video tutorial support
- Internationalization support
