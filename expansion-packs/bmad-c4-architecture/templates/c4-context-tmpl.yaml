      Based on the provided information, generate a complete Structurizr DSL workspace that creates a C4 Context diagram. Follow these guidelines:

      1. Use the system name and description for the workspace title
      2. Create person elements for each user type identified
      3. Create a software system element for the main system
      4. Create external software system elements for external systems
      5. Define relationships between users and the system, and between the system and external systems
      6. Include a systemContext view that shows all elements
      7. Use appropriate technology labels for relationships (e.g., "HTTPS", "API", "Database")
      8. Apply autolayout for better diagram appearance
      9. Use the default theme

      The DSL should be complete and ready to use with Structurizr Lite.
