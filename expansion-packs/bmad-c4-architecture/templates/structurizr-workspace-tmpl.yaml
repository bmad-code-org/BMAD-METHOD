      Based on the provided information, generate a complete Structurizr DSL workspace that includes all C4 model levels. Follow these guidelines:

      1. Create a workspace with the specified name and description
      2. Define the model section with all elements from all levels
      3. Create appropriate views for each C4 model level:
         - System context view for Level 1
         - Container views for Level 2
         - Component views for Level 3
      4. Use consistent naming and descriptions throughout
      5. Apply appropriate technology labels for relationships
      6. Include autolayout for all views
      7. Apply the default theme or specified styling
      8. Ensure all relationships are properly defined
      9. Make the DSL complete and ready to use with Structurizr Lite

      The DSL should be comprehensive and include all necessary elements for a complete C4 model representation.
