            Due to a change in the workflow file of the [BMAD-METHOD][upstream] upstream repository, GitHub has automatically suspended the scheduled automatic update. You need to manually sync your fork.

            ### How to fix
            1. Go to your fork on GitHub
            2. Click **Sync fork** → **Update branch**
            3. If there are conflicts, clone locally and resolve them
