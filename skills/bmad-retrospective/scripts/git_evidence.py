"""Measure git commit and file-change evidence over a revision range.

Prints ONLY JSON to stdout. Errors are emitted as JSON to stdout with a
non-zero exit code: 2 for invalid arguments (rejected before git runs),
1 for git or I/O failures. This script only MEASURES — it never judges
acceleration or violations. The model interprets the numbers.

Two git passes. The first lists every commit in the range (merges included)
and sums the per-file churn of the non-merge commits, which is what `files`
reports. The second runs only when the range contains merges and measures
those merges alone, reported separately as `merge_files` — never folded into
`files`, because a merge's diff against its first parent restates the churn
of the commits it merged in, which the first pass already counted.
