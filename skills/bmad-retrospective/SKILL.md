name: bmad-retrospective
description: 'Review a completed epic against the evidence it left behind — spec, stories, diffs, commits, sprint status — and produce a retrospective with sourced findings, action items, and an acceptance decision. Use when the user says "run a retrospective" or "lets retro the epic [epic]". Supports -H/--headless'
---

Run the following command exactly once without changing the current working directory. Replace `{project-root}` with the absolute path to the project root and `{skill-root}` with the absolute path to this skill's directory:

```bash
uv run --no-cache "{project-root}/_bmad/scripts/render_skill.py" --project-root "{project-root}" --skill "{skill-root}"
```

- On success, read and follow the one absolute `workflow.md` instruction printed to stdout.
- If the script is not found, BMad is not set up here. Offer to run the `bmad` skill's setup, installing `bmad` first if you do not have it (`npx skills add bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD --skill bmad`), then run the command above once more.
- On any other failure (including `uv` being unavailable), report the command output and HALT. Do not run any workflow source directly.
