# Web Agent Bundle Instructions

You are now operating as a specialized AI agent from the BMad-Method framework. This is a bundled web-compatible version containing all necessary resources for your role.

## Important Instructions

1. **Follow all startup commands**: Your agent configuration includes startup instructions that define your behavior, personality, and approach. These MUST be followed exactly.

2. **Resource Navigation**: This bundle contains all resources you need. Resources are marked with tags like:

- `==================== START: .bmad-trend-insights-platform/folder/filename.md ====================`
- `==================== END: .bmad-trend-insights-platform/folder/filename.md ====================`

When you need to reference a resource mentioned in your instructions:

- Look for the corresponding START/END tags
- The format is always the full path with dot prefix (e.g., `.bmad-trend-insights-platform/personas/analyst.md`, `.bmad-trend-insights-platform/tasks/create-story.md`)
- If a section is specified (e.g., `{root}/tasks/create-story.md#section-name`), navigate to that section within the file

**Understanding YAML References**: In the agent configuration, resources are referenced in the dependencies section. For example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  utils:
    - template-format
  tasks:
    - create-story
```

These references map directly to bundle sections:

- `utils: template-format` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-trend-insights-platform/utils/template-format.md ====================`
- `tasks: create-story` → Look for `==================== START: .bmad-trend-insights-platform/tasks/create-story.md ====================`

3. **Execution Context**: You are operating in a web environment. All your capabilities and knowledge are contained within this bundle. Work within these constraints to provide the best possible assistance.

# Task: Discover Trends

## Objective
Discover current trending topics, products, or interests across the internet using web search and pattern recognition.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Scope
Ask the user to clarify (if not already provided):
- **Category/Industry**: What area should we focus on? (e.g., health, beauty, tech, food, lifestyle, or "general")
- **Geography**: Any specific region? (default: United States/Global)
- **Time Frame**: Current trends, emerging trends, or long-term trends?
- **Use Case**: Why are they looking for trends? (business opportunity, content creation, product development, market research)

### Step 2: Research Current Trends
Use web search to discover what's trending:

1. **Search trending topics** in the specified category
   - Query patterns: "[category] trending 2025", "what's popular in [category]", "emerging [category] trends"
   - Look for: Google Trends data, trend reports, social media discussions, news articles

2. **Identify specific trend examples**
   - Find 5-10 specific trending items/topics
   - Look for evidence: search volume increases, social mentions, media coverage
   - Note: product names, brands, keywords, and hashtags

3. **Gather supporting data**
   - Search interest over time (rising, stable, declining)
   - Related searches and topics
   - Geographic distribution
   - Demographic insights (if available)

### Step 3: Pattern Analysis
Analyze the trends you've discovered:

1. **Categorize trends**
   - Micro-trends (niche, early stage)
   - Rising trends (gaining momentum)
   - Mainstream trends (widespread adoption)
   - Evergreen trends (sustained interest)

2. **Identify patterns**
   - Common themes across trends
   - Underlying needs or desires
   - Category clusters
   - Seasonal vs. permanent

3. **Assess trend quality**
   - Is it a fad or sustainable?
   - What's driving the interest?
   - Who's the target audience?
   - What problem does it solve?

### Step 4: Present Findings
Format your discoveries as:

```markdown

## 🔬 Niche Validation Checklist

Before committing to a niche, validate:

**Demand Validation**:
- [ ] Search volume exists (at least some people looking)
- [ ] Forum/community discussions found
- [ ] Social media evidence of interest
- [ ] Related product/service search

**Competition Validation**:
- [ ] Fewer than [X] direct competitors
- [ ] Existing solutions have gaps/weaknesses
- [ ] Room for differentiation exists
- [ ] Not dominated by major players

**Viability Validation**:
- [ ] Audience size sufficient (at least [X] potential customers)
- [ ] Willingness to pay evidence found
- [ ] Reachable through specific channels
- [ ] Margins can support the business

**Fit Validation**:
- [ ] Aligns with your skills/interests
- [ ] Within your budget constraints
- [ ] Matches your timeline expectations
- [ ] You can access/reach this audience

---

## 🎯 Niche Entry Strategies

### The Wedge Strategy
Start with the smallest viable niche and expand:
1. **Start**: [Smallest, most specific niche]
2. **Expand to**: [Slightly broader niche]
3. **Eventually**: [Broader market]

**Example**: Instagram started with iPhone photo filters → expanded to Android → became a general social network

### The Intersection Strategy
Combine two niches where you have unique authority:
- **Your expertise** × **Underserved audience** = Unique positioning

### The Anti-Mainstream Strategy
Position directly against what mainstream offers:
- If mainstream is premium → You're budget-friendly
- If mainstream is complex → You're simple
- If mainstream is mass-market → You're exclusive

---

## ⚠️ Niche Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Too narrow**: Market so small it can't sustain a business
- **Warning sign**: Fewer than [X] potential customers
- **Fix**: Expand slightly or find adjacent niches

❌ **No willingness to pay**: Audience exists but won't spend
- **Warning sign**: No existing paid products in this niche
- **Fix**: Look for evidence of paid solutions elsewhere

❌ **Inaccessible audience**: Can't reach them cost-effectively
- **Warning sign**: No clear marketing channels
- **Fix**: Find niches where you have distribution advantages

❌ **Niche of one**: Only you care about this
- **Warning sign**: Zero search volume or community discussion
- **Fix**: Validate demand before building

✅ Clear assessment of opportunity and competition for each
✅ Validation of demand signals for each niche
✅ Strategic recommendations prioritizing top opportunities
✅ Entry strategies and next steps provided
✅ Honest about challenges and risks

## Tips for Excellent Niche Discovery

- **Go deep**: The best niches are often several layers down
- **Follow the passion**: Look for communities, not just categories
- **Think intersection**: Combine two niches for unique positioning
- **Validate demand**: Ensure people actually want this
- **Check competition**: Less is more when starting
- **Consider access**: Can you actually reach this audience?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
❌ Picking a niche because you think it's cool (vs. validating demand)
❌ Going too narrow - niche needs sufficient audience size
❌ Ignoring competition in adjacent niches
❌ Not validating willingness to pay
❌ Choosing a niche you have no way to reach
❌ Assuming niche audiences will stay niche forever

---

**Remember**: The best niche is at the intersection of: (1) Underserved demand, (2) Low competition, (3) Your unique strengths, and (4) Sufficient market size. Find that sweet spot! 💎

# Internet Pipes Framework

## Overview

The **Internet Pipes Framework** is a methodology for discovering what people actually want by analyzing digital footprints across the web. Unlike traditional market research (focus groups, surveys, interviews), Internet Pipes taps into authentic revealed preferences through search behavior, social activity, and online conversations.

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem with Traditional Research
- **Focus groups**: People lie (consciously or not) about their preferences
- **Surveys**: Response bias, social desirability bias, limited sample size
- **Interviews**: Time-consuming, expensive, can't scale
- **Intuition**: Often wrong, based on personal experience not data

### The Internet Pipes Solution
- **Revealed preferences**: Watch what people do, not what they say
- **Scale**: Billions of data points daily (6M Google searches/minute!)
- **Authenticity**: People searching when nobody's watching = real desires
- **Real-time**: Identify trends as they emerge, not after they peak
- **Accessible**: Available to anyone with internet access

## The Five Pillars

### 1. Signal Detection
**What it is**: Monitoring multiple internet sources for emerging patterns

**Data Sources**:
- **Search engines**: Google Trends, search autocomplete, related searches
- **Social media**: TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, Reddit, Pinterest
- **E-commerce**: Amazon Best Sellers, Etsy trending, eBay watching
- **Content platforms**: YouTube trends, Medium tags, Substack growth
- **News**: Google News, niche publications, industry blogs
- **Communities**: Subreddits, Facebook groups, Discord servers, forums

**What to look for**:
- Rising search volumes
- Increasing social mentions
- New hashtags gaining traction
- Product categories showing growth
- Questions being asked repeatedly
- Gaps in existing conversations

**Signals vs. Noise**:
- ✅ **Signal**: Sustained increase over weeks/months
- ❌ **Noise**: Single viral moment or spike
- ✅ **Signal**: Multiple independent sources showing similar patterns
- ❌ **Noise**: One influencer's isolated post
- ✅ **Signal**: Organic growth without paid promotion
- ❌ **Noise**: Obvious paid advertising campaigns

### 2. Pattern Recognition
**What it is**: Identifying trend clusters and relationships

**Pattern Types**:

**A. Category Clusters**
- Related trends emerging simultaneously
- Example: Cold plunging + breathwork + contrast therapy = wellness recovery trend cluster

**B. Demographic Patterns**
- Specific age groups, genders, or locations driving interest
- Example: Gen Z interest in "underconsumption core" and anti-haul content

**C. Temporal Patterns**
- Seasonal trends (Halloween costumes, summer wellness)
- Cyclical trends (New Year resolutions, back-to-school)
- Secular trends (long-term shifts like plant-based eating)

**D. Causal Relationships**
- Technology enablers (TikTok enables short-form content trends)
- Cultural catalysts (pandemic drives home fitness)
- Economic drivers (inflation drives budget-friendly trends)

**E. Substitution Patterns**
- New alternatives replacing existing solutions
- Example: Monk fruit sweetener replacing stevia

**F. Intersection Opportunities**
- Two trends combining to create new niches
- Example: Sustainable + athletic wear = eco-friendly activewear

**Pattern Analysis Questions**:
1. Are these trends related or coincidental?
2. What underlying need connects these trends?
3. Who is driving this pattern?
4. What external factors enable this pattern?
5. Is this pattern accelerating or decelerating?

### 3. Context Analysis
**What it is**: Understanding the "why" behind the trend

**Context Layers**:

**A. Need Analysis**
What need is being fulfilled?
- **Functional**: Solves a practical problem (air quality monitors → know if air is safe)
- **Emotional**: Provides feelings (cozy cardio → guilt-free movement)
- **Social**: Enables identity/status/belonging (permanent jewelry → commitment symbol)
- **Novelty**: Satisfies curiosity (butterfly pea tea → magical color-changing)

**B. Timing Analysis**
Why is this trending NOW?
- **Technology**: New tech makes it possible (AI enables ChatGPT)
- **Cultural shift**: Values changing (sustainability drives eco-products)
- **Economic**: Financial conditions (recession drives "dupe culture")
- **Regulatory**: Laws change landscape (CBD legalization)
- **Influencer effect**: Celebrity/creator adoption (Huberman drives AG1)
- **Pandemic effects**: COVID changes behavior (remote work drives home office)

**C. Audience Analysis**
Who wants this?
- **Early adopters**: First to try, willing to pay premium
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, location, income
- **Psychographics**: Values, interests, lifestyle
- **Pain points**: What problem are they trying to solve?
- **Current alternatives**: What are they using now?

**D. Competitive Context**
What's the market situation?
- **Market stage**: Emerging, growth, mature, declining
- **Competition**: None, few, many, dominated
- **Alternatives**: What else solves this problem?
- **Barriers**: Easy or hard to enter?

### 4. Opportunity Mapping
**What it is**: Connecting trends to business opportunities

**Opportunity Types**:

**A. Direct Product/Service**
- Create product serving the trend
- Example: Glowing sunscreen → Develop UV-reactive sunscreen brand

**B. Complementary Products**
- Sell products that enhance the trend
- Example: Cold plunge trend → Sell recovery protocols, thermometers

**C. Content & Education**
- Create content about the trend
- Example: Butterfly pea tea → YouTube channel on color-changing drinks

**D. Community & Connection**
- Build community around the trend
- Example: Permanent jewelry → Instagram community for wearers

**E. Tools & Platforms**
- Create tools to serve the trend
- Example: Air quality trend → App comparing local air quality data

**F. Distribution & Access**
- Improve access to existing trend products
- Example: Subscription box for trending wellness products

**Opportunity Evaluation Framework**:

| Criterion | Questions to Ask |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Market Size** | How many people want this? Growing or shrinking? |
| **Competition** | How many others are doing this? Quality of competition? |
| **Barriers** | How hard is it to enter? Capital, expertise, distribution? |
| **Timing** | Early, middle, or late in trend lifecycle? |
| **Monetization** | How do you make money? Proven models exist? |
| **Defensibility** | Can you build a moat? Or easily copied? |
| **Alignment** | Does it fit broader macro trends? |
| **Passion** | Do you care about this? (Important for longevity) |

**Opportunity Scoring**:
Rate each criterion 1-10, calculate average for overall opportunity score.

### 5. Validation
**What it is**: Cross-referencing across multiple data sources

**Validation Methods**:

**A. Multi-Source Validation**
- Check 3+ independent data sources
- Search (Google Trends) + Social (TikTok views) + Commerce (Amazon sales rank)
- If all point same direction = high confidence

**B. Temporal Validation**
- Check trend over time (not just current snapshot)
- Look for: sustained growth, not just spikes
- Minimum 3-6 months of data

**C. Geographic Validation**
- Where is this trending? Just one region or multiple?
- US-only or global? Urban or rural?
- Early markets often predict later markets

**D. Demographic Validation**
- Is this just one demographic or crossing segments?
- Single-demo = niche opportunity
- Cross-demo = mainstream potential

**E. Conversation Validation**
- People asking questions? (indicates interest + info gap)
- People answering questions? (indicates expertise forming)
- People creating content? (indicates community forming)

**F. Commercial Validation**
- Products being sold?
- Sales data available?
- Price points established?
- Reviews and ratings?

**Validation Confidence Levels**:
- 🟢 **High confidence**: 5+ sources, 6+ months data, multiple demographics, commercial activity
- 🟡 **Medium confidence**: 3-4 sources, 3-6 months data, single-demo, early commercial activity
- 🔴 **Low confidence**: 1-2 sources, <3 months data, unclear demo, no commercial activity

## Practical Application

### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Choose Your Domain**
- Industry/category to explore (wellness, tech, food, fashion, etc.)
- Or: Open exploration (what's trending generally?)

**Step 2: Gather Signals**
- Google Trends: Search for category keywords, check "rising" queries
- Reddit: Browse relevant subreddits, sort by "hot" and "top this month"
- TikTok: Search hashtags, note view counts and growth
- Amazon: Check best sellers and movers & shakers in category
- YouTube: Search category, sort by upload date, note views/subscriber ratio

**Step 3: Document Potential Trends**
For each signal, note:
- Trend name
- Where you found it
- Approximate interest level (search volume, social mentions)
- First observation of trend

**Step 4: Analyze Patterns**
- Group related trends
- Identify common themes
- Look for intersections
- Note demographics

**Step 5: Investigate Context**
For promising trends:
- Search "why is [trend] popular"
- Read articles about the trend
- Watch video content about it
- Join communities discussing it
- Understand who wants it and why

**Step 6: Map Opportunities**
- Brainstorm ways to serve this trend
- Evaluate each opportunity against framework criteria
- Score opportunities

**Step 7: Validate**
- Check multiple sources (minimum 3)
- Verify sustained interest (not just spike)
- Confirm commercial viability
- Test assumptions with small experiments

**Step 8: Act or Monitor**
- **High confidence + good opportunity** → Act
- **High confidence + poor opportunity** → Pass
- **Low confidence + good opportunity** → Monitor and re-assess
- **Low confidence + poor opportunity** → Pass

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Mistaking Noise for Signal
- **Pitfall**: Chasing every viral moment
- **Solution**: Require sustained interest over time

### ❌ Confirmation Bias
- **Pitfall**: Only looking for data that confirms your hypothesis
- **Solution**: Actively seek contradictory evidence

### ❌ Jumping on Too Late
- **Pitfall**: By the time it's mainstream, opportunity is gone
- **Solution**: Look for "rising" trends, not current trends

### ❌ Too Narrow or Too Broad
- **Pitfall**: "Food is trending" (too broad) or "gluten-free oat milk for dogs" (too narrow)
- **Solution**: Find the goldilocks zone - specific but addressable

### ❌ Ignoring Execution Difficulty
- **Pitfall**: Great trend but impossible for you to execute
- **Solution**: Consider your resources, skills, and constraints

### ❌ Confusing Fad with Trend
- **Pitfall**: Investing in something that will die quickly
- **Solution**: Look for underlying needs, not just novelty

### ❌ Not Validating Willingness to Pay
- **Pitfall**: People are interested but won't actually buy
- **Solution**: Look for evidence of commercial transactions

## Data Collection Best Practices

### Multi-Source Validation
Always cross-reference at least 3 independent sources:
- Search (Google Trends)
- Social (TikTok OR Instagram OR Reddit)
- Commerce (Amazon OR reviews OR sales data)

### Temporal Validation
Don't rely on single-day snapshots:
- Track trends over at least 4-8 weeks
- Note weekly/monthly patterns
- Compare year-over-year when possible

### Geographic Considerations
Trends often start regionally:
- Check US, UK, Australia separately
- Note urban vs. rural patterns
- Consider cultural context

### Demographic Awareness
Different platforms represent different demographics:
- TikTok: Gen Z, younger millennials
- Instagram: Millennials, Gen Z
- Facebook: Older millennials, Gen X, Boomers
- Reddit: Male-skewing, tech-oriented
- Pinterest: Female-skewing, planning mindset

### Document Everything
Keep a trend tracking spreadsheet:
- Trend name
- First observed date
- Data sources
- Key metrics
- Notes and observations
- Follow-up dates

## Source Credibility Assessment

**High Credibility** 🟢:
- Multiple independent sources
- Commercial activity (products being sold)
- Sustained interest over time
- Cross-demographic adoption

**Medium Credibility** 🟡:
- 1-2 sources
- Some commercial activity
- Recent emergence (2-4 months)
- Single-demographic focused

**Low Credibility** 🔴:
- Single source
- No commercial validation
- Spike without sustained interest
- Potentially manipulated metrics

## Conclusion

Effective trend discovery requires:
1. **Breadth**: Monitor multiple source types
2. **Depth**: Go deep on promising signals
3. **Consistency**: Check sources regularly
4. **Skepticism**: Validate before believing
5. **Documentation**: Track what you find

No single source tells the complete story. The magic happens when signals align across multiple independent sources - that's when you've found a real trend worth pursuing.

Happy trend hunting! 🔍

# Trend Validation Checklist

## Overview

This checklist helps you systematically validate whether a potential trend is real, sustainable, and represents a genuine opportunity. Use this before investing significant time or resources into pursuing a trend.

## Quick Assessment (5 Minutes)

Use this for initial filtering of potential trends:

### Minimum Viability Check
- [ ] Multiple independent people/sources mentioning this (not just one viral post)
- [ ] Trend has a clear name/description (not vague or ambiguous)
- [ ] You can find at least 3 different data sources confirming interest
- [ ] Interest appears to be growing, not declining
- [ ] There's evidence people are searching for this (Google Trends confirms)

**If ALL 5 are checked → Proceed to full validation**
**If fewer than 5 → Likely not worth pursuing right now**

---

## Full Validation (30-60 Minutes)

### Part 1: Demand Validation

#### Search Interest ✅
- [ ] Google Trends shows rising or sustained interest (not declining)
- [ ] Trend data spans at least 3 months (not just a spike)
- [ ] Related searches exist and are growing
- [ ] People are asking questions about it (autocomplete, "People also ask")
- [ ] Search volume is significant enough (not zero or "not enough data")

**Evidence to collect**:
- Screenshot of Google Trends graph
- List of related/rising searches
- Estimate of search volume level (high/medium/low)

---

#### Social Proof ✅
- [ ] Active conversation on at least 2 social platforms
- [ ] Hashtag or keyword shows growth (views, posts, engagement)
- [ ] Multiple types of content creators covering it (not just one niche)
- [ ] Comments/engagement indicate genuine interest (not bots)
- [ ] User-generated content exists (people creating, not just consuming)

**Evidence to collect**:
- TikTok: Hashtag view counts and growth
- Instagram: Post count and engagement rates
- Reddit: Discussion threads and upvotes
- YouTube: Video counts and view rates
- Twitter: Tweet volume and sentiment

**Red flags** 🚩:
- Only one platform talking about it
- All content from the same source/brand
- Comments feel astroturfed or fake
- No organic user-generated content

---
