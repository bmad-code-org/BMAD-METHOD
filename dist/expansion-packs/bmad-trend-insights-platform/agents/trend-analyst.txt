# Task: Discover Trends

## Objective
Discover current trending topics, products, or interests across the internet using web search and pattern recognition.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Scope
Ask the user to clarify (if not already provided):

- **Geography**: Any specific region? (default: United States/Global)
- **Time Frame**: Current trends, emerging trends, or long-term trends?
- **Use Case**: Why are they looking for trends? (business opportunity, content creation, product development, market research)

### Step 2: Research Current Trends
Use web search to discover what's trending:

1. **Search trending topics** in the specified category
   - Query patterns: "[category] trending 2025", "what's popular in [category]", "emerging [category] trends"
   - Look for: Google Trends data, trend reports, social media discussions, news articles

2. **Identify specific trend examples**
   - Find 5-10 specific trending items/topics
   - Look for evidence: search volume increases, social mentions, media coverage
   - Note: product names, brands, keywords, and hashtags

3. **Gather supporting data**
   - Search interest over time (rising, stable, declining)
   - Related searches and topics
   - Geographic distribution
   - Demographic insights (if available)

### Step 3: Pattern Analysis
Analyze the trends you've discovered:

1. **Categorize trends**
   - Micro-trends (niche, early stage)
   - Rising trends (gaining momentum)
   - Mainstream trends (widespread adoption)
   - Evergreen trends (sustained interest)

2. **Identify patterns**
   - Common themes across trends
   - Underlying needs or desires
   - Category clusters
   - Seasonal vs. permanent

3. **Assess trend quality**
   - Is it a fad or sustainable?
   - What's driving the interest?
   - Who's the target audience?
   - What problem does it solve?

### Step 4: Present Findings
Format your discoveries as:

```markdown

- üß† **Strategic thinking**: Why it matters, not just what it is
- üí° **Actionable recommendations**: Specific moves, not vague advice
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Balanced perspective**: Opportunities AND risks
- üîÆ **Forward-looking**: Where things are headed

### Avoid:
- ‚ùå Listing obvious trends everyone knows
- ‚ùå Vague descriptions without data
- ‚ùå Analysis without strategic implications
- ‚ùå Recommendations without reasoning
- ‚ùå Ignoring risks or overhyping opportunities
- ‚ùå Treating all trends as equally valuable

## Tips for Standout Reports

1. **Lead with insights, not data**: Data supports insights, not the other way around
2. **Think like an operator**: What would you do with this information?
3. **Be opinionated**: Take positions on which trends matter most
4. **Connect dots**: Show relationships between trends
5. **Write for skimming**: Use clear headers, bullets, and visual indicators
6. **Update regularly**: Trends change; reports should have refresh dates

**Remember**: A great trend report is a strategic asset. It should inform decisions, spark ideas, and reveal opportunities that competitors miss. That's the power of Internet Pipes! üöÄüìä

## Tips for Excellent Niche Discovery

- **Go deep**: The best niches are often several layers down

- **Think intersection**: Combine two niches for unique positioning
- **Validate demand**: Ensure people actually want this
- **Check competition**: Less is more when starting
- **Consider access**: Can you actually reach this audience?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
‚ùå Picking a niche because you think it's cool (vs. validating demand)
‚ùå Going too narrow - niche needs sufficient audience size
‚ùå Ignoring competition in adjacent niches
‚ùå Not validating willingness to pay
‚ùå Choosing a niche you have no way to reach
‚ùå Assuming niche audiences will stay niche forever

---

# Internet Pipes Framework

## Overview

The **Internet Pipes Framework** is a methodology for discovering what people actually want by analyzing digital footprints across the web. Unlike traditional market research (focus groups, surveys, interviews), Internet Pipes taps into authentic revealed preferences through search behavior, social activity, and online conversations.

## Core Philosophy

### The Problem with Traditional Research
- **Focus groups**: People lie (consciously or not) about their preferences
- **Surveys**: Response bias, social desirability bias, limited sample size
- **Interviews**: Time-consuming, expensive, can't scale
- **Intuition**: Often wrong, based on personal experience not data

### The Internet Pipes Solution
- **Revealed preferences**: Watch what people do, not what they say
- **Scale**: Billions of data points daily (6M Google searches/minute!)
- **Authenticity**: People searching when nobody's watching = real desires
- **Real-time**: Identify trends as they emerge, not after they peak
- **Accessible**: Available to anyone with internet access

## The Five Pillars

### 1. Signal Detection
**What it is**: Monitoring multiple internet sources for emerging patterns

**Data Sources**:
- **Search engines**: Google Trends, search autocomplete, related searches
- **Social media**: TikTok, Instagram, Twitter/X, Reddit, Pinterest
- **E-commerce**: Amazon Best Sellers, Etsy trending, eBay watching
- **Content platforms**: YouTube trends, Medium tags, Substack growth
- **News**: Google News, niche publications, industry blogs
- **Communities**: Subreddits, Facebook groups, Discord servers, forums

**What to look for**:
- Rising search volumes
- Increasing social mentions
- New hashtags gaining traction
- Product categories showing growth
- Questions being asked repeatedly
- Gaps in existing conversations

**Signals vs. Noise**:
- ‚úÖ **Signal**: Sustained increase over weeks/months
- ‚ùå **Noise**: Single viral moment or spike
- ‚úÖ **Signal**: Multiple independent sources showing similar patterns
- ‚ùå **Noise**: One influencer's isolated post
- ‚úÖ **Signal**: Organic growth without paid promotion
- ‚ùå **Noise**: Obvious paid advertising campaigns

### 2. Pattern Recognition
**What it is**: Identifying trend clusters and relationships

**Pattern Types**:

**A. Category Clusters**
- Related trends emerging simultaneously
- Example: Cold plunging + breathwork + contrast therapy = wellness recovery trend cluster

**B. Demographic Patterns**
- Specific age groups, genders, or locations driving interest
- Example: Gen Z interest in "underconsumption core" and anti-haul content

**C. Temporal Patterns**
- Seasonal trends (Halloween costumes, summer wellness)

- Secular trends (long-term shifts like plant-based eating)

**D. Causal Relationships**

- Economic drivers (inflation drives budget-friendly trends)

**E. Substitution Patterns**

**Pattern Analysis Questions**:
1. Are these trends related or coincidental?
2. What underlying need connects these trends?
3. Who is driving this pattern?
4. What external factors enable this pattern?
5. Is this pattern accelerating or decelerating?

### 3. Context Analysis

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ‚ùå Mistaking Noise for Signal
- **Pitfall**: Chasing every viral moment
- **Solution**: Require sustained interest over time

### ‚ùå Confirmation Bias
- **Pitfall**: Only looking for data that confirms your hypothesis
- **Solution**: Actively seek contradictory evidence

### ‚ùå Jumping on Too Late
- **Pitfall**: By the time it's mainstream, opportunity is gone
- **Solution**: Look for "rising" trends, not current trends

### ‚ùå Too Narrow or Too Broad
- **Pitfall**: "Food is trending" (too broad) or "gluten-free oat milk for dogs" (too narrow)
- **Solution**: Find the goldilocks zone - specific but addressable

### ‚ùå Ignoring Execution Difficulty
- **Pitfall**: Great trend but impossible for you to execute
- **Solution**: Consider your resources, skills, and constraints

### ‚ùå Confusing Fad with Trend
- **Pitfall**: Investing in something that will die quickly
- **Solution**: Look for underlying needs, not just novelty

### ‚ùå Not Validating Willingness to Pay
- **Pitfall**: People are interested but won't actually buy
- **Solution**: Look for evidence of commercial transactions

- Note urban vs. rural patterns
- Consider cultural context

### Demographic Awareness
Different platforms represent different demographics:
- TikTok: Gen Z, younger millennials
- Instagram: Millennials, Gen Z
- Facebook: Older millennials, Gen X, Boomers
- Reddit: Male-skewing, tech-oriented
- Pinterest: Female-skewing, planning mindset

### Document Everything
Keep a trend tracking spreadsheet:
- Trend name
- First observed date
- Data sources
- Key metrics
- Notes and observations
- Follow-up dates

## Source Credibility Assessment

**High Credibility** üü¢:
- Multiple independent sources
- Commercial activity (products being sold)
- Sustained interest over time
- Cross-demographic adoption

**Medium Credibility** üü°:
- 1-2 sources
- Some commercial activity
- Recent emergence (2-4 months)
- Single-demographic focused

**Low Credibility** üî¥:
- Single source
- No commercial validation
- Spike without sustained interest
- Potentially manipulated metrics

## Conclusion

Effective trend discovery requires:
1. **Breadth**: Monitor multiple source types
2. **Depth**: Go deep on promising signals
3. **Consistency**: Check sources regularly
4. **Skepticism**: Validate before believing
5. **Documentation**: Track what you find

No single source tells the complete story. The magic happens when signals align across multiple independent sources - that's when you've found a real trend worth pursuing.

Happy trend hunting! üîç

# Trend Validation Checklist

## Overview

This checklist helps you systematically validate whether a potential trend is real, sustainable, and represents a genuine opportunity. Use this before investing significant time or resources into pursuing a trend.

## Quick Assessment (5 Minutes)

Use this for initial filtering of potential trends:

### Minimum Viability Check
- [ ] Multiple independent people/sources mentioning this (not just one viral post)
- [ ] Trend has a clear name/description (not vague or ambiguous)
- [ ] You can find at least 3 different data sources confirming interest
- [ ] Interest appears to be growing, not declining
- [ ] There's evidence people are searching for this (Google Trends confirms)

**If ALL 5 are checked ‚Üí Proceed to full validation**
**If fewer than 5 ‚Üí Likely not worth pursuing right now**

---
