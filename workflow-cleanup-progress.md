# Workflow Cleanup Progress Tracker

**Started:** 2025-10-15
**Goal:** Standardize all BMM/BMB/CIS workflows with proper config variables, yaml/instruction alignment, and web_bundle validation

---

## Scope

- **Total Workflows:** 42
  - BMM: 30 workflows
  - BMB: 8 workflows
  - CIS: 4 workflows
- **Excluded:** testarch/\* workflows

---

## Phase 1: Fix BMB Documentation (Foundation)

### Files to Update:

- [ ] `/src/modules/bmb/workflows/create-workflow/instructions.md`
- [ ] `/src/modules/bmb/workflows/edit-workflow/instructions.md`
- [ ] `/src/modules/bmb/workflows/convert-legacy/instructions.md`

### Standards Being Enforced:

1. Standard config block in all workflows
2. Instructions must use config variables
3. Templates must use config variables
4. Yaml variables must be used (instructions OR templates)
5. Web_bundle must include all dependencies

### Progress:

- Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Completed:

- ✅ **create-workflow/instructions.md** - Added:
  - Standard config block enforcement in Step 4
  - Config variable usage guidance in Step 5 (instructions)
  - Standard metadata in templates in Step 6
  - YAML/instruction/template alignment validation in Step 9
  - Enhanced web_bundle dependency scanning in Step 9b (workflow calls)

- ✅ **edit-workflow/instructions.md** - Added:

## Phase 2: Global Config Variable Sweep

### Standard Config Block:

```yaml
# Critical variables from config
config_source: '{project-root}/bmad/[module]/config.yaml'
output_folder: '{config_source}:output_folder'
user_name: '{config_source}:user_name'
communication_language: '{config_source}:communication_language'
date: system-generated
```

### Rules:

- Add to existing config section (don't duplicate)
- Only add missing variables
- Skip testarch/\* workflows

### Progress:

- Status: ✅ COMPLETE
- Workflows Updated: 34/34 (excluded 8 testarch workflows)
- Added `communication_language` to all workflows missing it
- Standardized comment: "Critical variables from config"

---

## Phase 3: Workflow-by-Workflow Deep Clean

### Per-Workflow Checklist:

1. Read workflow.yaml + instructions.md + template.md (if exists)
2. Variable audit (yaml ↔ instructions ↔ templates)
3. Standard config usage validation
4. Bloat removal (unused fields, duplicates)
5. Web_bundle validation (all dependencies included)

### Progress:

## Issues/Notes Log

### 2025-10-16: Created audit-workflow

- **Location:** `/bmad/bmb/workflows/audit-workflow/`
- **Purpose:** Codifies all Phase 1 and Phase 2 standards into a reusable validation tool
- **Files Created:**
  - `workflow.yaml` - Configuration with standard config block
  - `instructions.md` - 8-step audit process
  - `checklist.md` - 70-point validation checklist
- **Validation:** audit-workflow passes 100% of its own validation criteria
- **Next Use:** Will be used to perform Phase 3 systematic audits

**Audit-Workflow Capabilities:**

1. Standard config block validation
2. YAML/instruction/template alignment analysis
3. Config variable usage audit
4. Web bundle completeness validation
5. Bloat detection (unused yaml fields)
6. Template variable mapping verification
7. Comprehensive audit report generation
8. Integration with edit-workflow for fixes

### 2025-10-16: Added Instruction Style Philosophy to create-workflow

- **Enhancement:** Added comprehensive guidance on intent-based vs prescriptive instruction patterns
- **Location:** `/src/modules/bmb/workflows/create-workflow/instructions.md` Step 5
- **Changes:**
  - Added instruction style choice in Step 3 (intent-based vs prescriptive)
  - Added 100+ line section in Step 5 with examples and best practices
  - Documented when to use each style and how to mix both effectively
  - Provided clear "good" and "bad" examples for each pattern
  - Emphasized goal-oriented collaboration over rigid prescriptive wording

**Key Philosophy Shift:**

- **Intent-Based (Recommended):** Guide LLM with goals and principles, let it adapt conversations naturally
  - Better for complex discovery, creative work, iterative refinement
  - Example: `<action>Guide user to define their target audience with specific demographics and needs</action>`

- **Prescriptive (Selective Use):** Provide exact wording for questions and options
  - Better for simple data collection, compliance, binary choices
  - Example: `<ask>What is your target platform? Choose: PC, Console, Mobile, Web</ask>`

**Impact:** Future workflows will be more conversational and adaptive, improving human-AI collaboration quality

### 2025-10-16: Transformed game-brief to Intent-Based Style

- **Transformation:** Converted game-brief from prescriptive to intent-based instructions
- **Location:** `/src/modules/bmm/workflows/1-analysis/game-brief/instructions.md`
- **Results:**
  - **Before:** 617 lines (heavily prescriptive with hardcoded question templates)
  - **After:** 370 lines (intent-based with goal-oriented guidance)
  - **Reduction:** 247 lines removed (40% reduction)

**Changes Made:**

- Step 1: Converted hardcoded "What is the working title?" to intent-based "Ask for the working title"
- Step 1b: Transformed 7 prescriptive bullet points to 5 action-based guidance lines
- Steps 3-12 (Interactive Mode): Replaced massive <ask> blocks with compact <action> guidance
  - Step 4 (Target Market): 31 lines → 8 lines
  - Step 5 (Game Fundamentals): 33 lines → 10 lines
  - Step 6 (Scope/Constraints): 47 lines → 11 lines
  - Step 7 (Reference Framework): 33 lines → 8 lines
  - Step 8 (Content Framework): 32 lines → 9 lines
  - Step 9 (Art/Audio): 32 lines → 8 lines
  - Step 10 (Risks): 38 lines → 9 lines
  - Step 11 (Success): 37 lines → 9 lines
  - Step 12 (Next Steps): 35 lines → 9 lines

**Pattern Applied:**

- **Old (Prescriptive):** `<ask>Who will play your game? **Primary Audience:** - Age range - Gaming experience level...</ask>`
- **New (Intent-Based):** `<action>Guide user to define their primary target audience with specific demographics, gaming preferences, and behavioral characteristics</action>`

**Benefits:**

- More conversational and adaptive LLM behavior
- Cleaner, more maintainable instructions
- Better human-AI collaboration
- LLM can adapt questions to user context naturally
- Demonstrates the philosophy shift documented in create-workflow

**This serves as the reference implementation for converting prescriptive workflows to intent-based style.**

### 2025-10-16: Completed ALL 3-solutioning Workflows (2/2 - 100%)

**✅ Phase 3-Solutioning Module Complete!**

All 2 workflows in the 3-solutioning folder have been audited and cleaned:

1. ✅ **solution-architecture** (main workflow) - DETERMINISTIC VALIDATION
   - **YAML:** Already clean - no metadata bloat found
   - Added {communication_language} critical header
   - Added {user_name} personalization in completion message (Step 11)
   - **Appropriately deterministic:** Router/orchestration workflow with validation gates
   - **Not transformed to intent-based:** This is a systematic architecture generation workflow with specific quality gates (cohesion check, template loading, validation checklists)

2. ✅ **tech-spec** (subfolder) - METADATA BLOAT CLEANUP
   - **YAML:** Removed metadata bloat (required_tools, tags, execution_hints)
   - Added {communication_language} critical header
   - Added {user_name} personalization in completion message (Step 10)
   - **Appropriately deterministic:** JIT workflow with #yolo (non-interactive) execution mode

**Metadata Bloat Removed:**

- `tags` (4 items: tech-spec, architecture, planning, bmad-v6)
- `execution_hints` (interactive/autonomous/iterative flags)

**Standard Additions Applied:**

- {communication_language} critical header in both instruction files
- {user_name} personalization in all completion messages
- Both workflows now follow standard config usage pattern

**Instruction Style Decision:**

- **Deterministic/Prescriptive:** Both workflows appropriately remain deterministic
  - solution-architecture: Complex router with quality gates, template selection, validation checklists
  - tech-spec: Non-interactive #yolo mode workflow with structured spec generation
- **Rationale:** These are systematic, validation-heavy workflows, not conversational discovery workflows
