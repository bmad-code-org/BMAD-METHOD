## 1. Project Overview

### What is WDS?

**Whiteport Design Studio (WDS)** is a design-focused methodology module for the BMad Method ecosystem. It provides a complete UX/UI design workflow from product exploration through detailed component specifications.

### Origin

WDS evolves from **Whiteport Sketch-to-Code (WPS2C)**, a BMad v4 "expansion pack." The v6 conversion transforms it into a proper BMad module following v6 architecture.

### Core Purpose

WDS focuses **exclusively on design** - it creates the design artifacts that feed into development modules like BMad Method (BMM). WDS does NOT include development/backlog functionality.

### Integration Model

```
WDS (Design) ────────► E-UI-Roadmap/ ────────► BMM (Development)
    │                       │                       │
    │ Creates:              │ Bridge:               │ Consumes:
    │ • Product Brief       │ • Priority mapping    │ • Architecture
    │ • Trigger Map         │ • Technical notes     │ • Stories
    │ • Scenarios           │ • Handoff checklist   │ • Implementation
    │ • PRD                 │                       │
    │ • Design System       │                       │
```

## 2. Key Decisions Made

### 2.1 Module Name

**Decision:** Whiteport Design Studio (WDS)

**Alternatives Considered:**
- BMad Design Studio
- BMad UX

**Reasoning:** Preserve brand identity, acknowledge contribution origin, maintain "Whiteport" recognition.

### 2.2 Repository Approach

**Decision:** Fork BMad-METHOD repository

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Standalone repository
- Rename existing WPS2C repo

**Reasoning:**
- Maximum adoption through BMad ecosystem
- Path to official module status via PR
- Shared core infrastructure
- Automatic ecosystem integration

**Fork Details:**
- Origin: `https://github.com/whiteport-collective/whiteport-design-studio.git`
- Upstream: `https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD.git`

### 2.3 Working Branch

**Decision:** Work directly on `main` branch

**Reasoning:**
- Simpler workflow during development
- WDS is substantial addition, not small tweak
- Fork effectively becomes WDS home
- Will switch to feature branches after official adoption

### 2.4 Workflow Approach

**Decision:** Phase-selectable (not rigid tracks)

**Description:** Users select individual phases based on project needs rather than choosing from predefined tracks.

**Examples:**
- Landing page → Phases 1, 4, 5
- Full product → All 6 phases
- Design system only → Phases 4, 5

### 2.5 Development Handoff

**Decision:** No development artifacts in WDS

**Description:** WDS creates design artifacts only. Development (backlog, stories, architecture) handled by BMM. `E-UI-Roadmap/` serves as the integration bridge.

### 2.6 README Convention

**Decision:** One README.md per repository

**Convention:** Only `README.md` at module root; all other documentation uses `xxx-guide.md` naming pattern.

**Examples:**
- ✅ `wds/README.md` (only one)
- ✅ `wds/docs/method/wds-method-guide.md`
- ✅ `wds/docs/quick-start-guide.md`
- ❌ `wds/docs/README.md` (not allowed)
- ❌ `wds/examples/README.md` (not allowed)

## 5. Output Folder Structure

### 5.1 The A-B-C-D-E Convention

WDS creates an alphabetized folder structure in the user's project `docs/` folder:

```
docs/
├── A-Product-Brief/            # Phase 1: Product Exploration outputs
├── B-Trigger-Map/              # Phase 2: Trigger Mapping outputs
├── C-Platform-Requirements/    # Phase 3: Technical foundation (platform, architecture, integrations)
├── C-Scenarios/                # Phase 4: UX Design (sketches & specifications)
├── D-Design-System/            # Phase 5: Component Library (optional, parallel)
├── E-PRD        # Phase 6: Design-Deliveries,Packaged flows for BMM handoff
├── F-Testing/                  # Phase 7: Testing validation and issues
└── G-Product-Development/      # Phase 8: Ongoing product development (existing products)
```

**Note:** 
- **C-Platform-Requirements/** and **C-Scenarios/** both use "C" prefix because Phase 3 and 4 run in parallel
- **Platform Requirements** (C-Platform-Requirements/) stays separate - technical foundation
- **E-PRD/** contains both the PRD and Design Deliveries (DD-XXX.yaml packages for BMM handoff)
- F-Testing/ contains test scenarios, validation results, and issues created during Phase 7
- G-Product-Development/ is used for Phase 8 (ongoing improvements to existing products)

### 5.2 Why Alphabetical Prefix?

| Reason | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Visual namespace | Clearly grouped in file explorers |
| Brand signature | "A-B-C-D-E = WDS" recognition |
| Non-conflicting | Won't clash with other docs folders |
| Natural sort | Always grouped together |
| Professional | Enterprise documentation feel |

### 5.3 Phase-to-Folder Mapping

| Phase | # | Name | Output Folder |
|-------|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | Product Exploration | Product Brief | `A-Product-Brief/` |
| 2 | Trigger Mapping | User psychology & business goals | `B-Trigger-Map/` |
| 3 | PRD Platform | Technical foundation (platform only) | `C-Platform-Requirements/` |
| 4 | UX Design | Scenarios, sketches, specifications | `C-Scenarios/` |
| 5 | Design System | Component library (optional, parallel) | `D-Design-System/` |
| 6 | PRD & Design Deliveries | PRD + packaged flows for BMM handoff | `E-PRD/` |
| 7 | Testing | Designer validation of implementation | `F-Testing/` |
| 8 | Product Development | Ongoing improvements (existing products) | `G-Product-Development/` |

### 5.4 E-PRD Structure (PRD + Design Deliveries)

**E-PRD/ contains both the PRD and Design Deliveries:**

**Phase 3: Platform Requirements (Technical Foundation)**
```
C-Platform-Requirements/
├── 00-Platform-Overview.md         # Platform summary
├── 01-Platform-Architecture.md     # Tech stack, infrastructure
├── 02-Data-Model.md                # Core entities, relationships
├── 03-Integration-Map.md           # External services
├── 04-Security-Framework.md        # Auth, authorization, data protection
└── 05-Technical-Constraints.md     # What design needs to know
```
**Purpose:** Technical foundation created by WDS. Referenced by PRD but kept separate.

**Phase 6: E-PRD (PRD + Design Deliveries)**
```
E-PRD/
├── 00-PRD.md                       # Main PRD document
│   ├── Reference to Platform       # Links to C-Platform-Requirements/
│   ├── Functional Requirements     # From design deliveries
│   ├── Feature Dependencies        # Organized by epic
│   └── Development Sequence        # Priority order
│
└── Design-Deliveries/              # Packaged flows for BMM handoff
    ├── DD-001-login-onboarding.yaml
    ├── DD-002-booking-flow.yaml
    ├── DD-003-profile-management.yaml
    └── ...
```

**Each Design Delivery (DD-XXX.yaml) contains:**
- Flow metadata (name, epic, priority)
- Scenario references (which pages in C-Scenarios/)
- Component references (which components in D-Design-System/)
- Functional requirements discovered during design
- Test scenarios (validation criteria)
- Technical notes and constraints

**Key Insight:** E-PRD/ is a **unified folder** containing both the PRD document and the design delivery packages. BMM can consume either the PRD or the individual design deliveries.

## 6. Design Philosophy

### 6.1 Core Principles

#### Principle 1: Soft Language

**Instead of:** "MUST", "FORBIDDEN", "NEVER", "SYSTEM FAILURE"

**Use:** Collaborative, identity-based guidance

**Reasoning:** User experience shows that harsh enforcement language makes agents MORE likely to ignore instructions, not less.

**Example - Before:**
```markdown
## MANDATORY RULES
- 🛑 NEVER generate without input
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN: Multiple questions
- ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE if you skip
```

**Example - After:**
```markdown
## How We Work Together

You're a thoughtful guide who helps designers create great products.

Your rhythm:
- Ask one question, then listen
- Reflect back what you heard
- Build the document together
```

#### Principle 2: Show, Don't Tell

**Instead of:** Explaining rules

**Use:** Concrete examples

**Reasoning:** People (and LLMs) learn better from examples than abstract rules.

**Implementation:**
- Complete artifacts as examples (not rule descriptions)
- Conversation flow examples
- Dog Week as reference implementation

#### Principle 3: Example Projects for Adoption

**Purpose:**
- Let people try before adopting
- Show what success looks like
- Lower barrier to entry
- Build credibility

**Implementation:**
- Dog Week patterns as full reference
- Starter project for practice
- Conversation examples showing dialog flow

### 6.2 Known Problems to Mitigate

| Problem | Observed Behavior | WDS Solution |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Agents ignore instructions | Generate without thinking | Identity-based personas + examples |
| Inconsistent output formats | Specs look different each time | Complete template examples |
| Question dumping | 20 questions at once | Conversation examples showing one-at-a-time |

### 6.3 Positive Language Guidelines

**Principle:** Frame everything in terms of benefits and opportunities, not problems and costs.

**Patterns to Avoid:**

| Negative Pattern | Positive Alternative |
|------------------|---------------------|
| "Nothing kills a project faster than..." | "It's valuable to discover early..." |
| "expensive development problems" | "easy to address while solutions are flexible" |
| "Finding them later is expensive" | "Finding them now means more options" |
| "Don't do X" | "What works well is Y" |
| "Avoid these mistakes" | "Successful patterns include..." |
| "This prevents failure" | "This enables success" |
| "You'll waste time if..." | "You'll save time by..." |

**The Reframe Test:**

When writing guidance, ask: *"Am I describing what TO DO or what NOT to do?"*

Good WDS documentation:
- Celebrates early discovery (not fears late discovery)
- Describes successful patterns (not failure modes)
- Frames constraints as opportunities (not limitations)
- Uses "enables" not "prevents"

**Example Transformation:**

Before:
> "Nothing kills a project faster than discovering in development that a core feature is technically impossible."

After:
> "It's a great morale boost when you've proven your core features will work. And if you discover limitations, it's valuable to know them early so design can account for them from the start."

### 6.4 Instruction Style

**Identity-First:**
```markdown
## Who You Are

You're Saga, a thoughtful analyst who genuinely cares 
about understanding the product before documenting it.

You prefer deep conversations over quick surveys. You ask one 
thing at a time because you're actually listening.
```

**Experience-Focused:**
```markdown
## The Conversation Style

A good session feels like coffee with a wise mentor:
- They ask something interesting
- You share your thinking
- They reflect it back
- Together you discover something new
```

**Gentle Reminders:**
```markdown
## Helpful Patterns

What works well:
- One question at a time keeps things focused
- Reflecting back shows you're listening

What tends to feel less collaborative:
- Listing many questions (feels like a survey)
- Generating without checking in
```

### Key Methodology Features

**Feature Impact Analysis (Phase 2):**
- Scoring system for prioritizing features
- Positive drivers: +3/+2/+1 by priority
- Negative drivers: +4/+3/+2 (higher due to loss aversion)
- Bonuses for multi-group and multi-driver features
- Outputs ranked feature list for MVP planning

**Platform Requirements (Phase 3):**
- Technical foundation work (platform, infrastructure)
- Proofs of concept for risky features
- Experimental endpoints that can start before design
- Runs in parallel with design work (not sequential)

**Design System (Phase 5):**
- Optional - chosen during project setup
- Parallel - builds alongside Phase 4, not after
- Unified naming for Figma/Code integration
- Component library selection guidance

**PRD Structure (Phase 6):**
- E-PRD/ contains both PRD document and Design Deliveries subfolder
- PRD references C-Platform-Requirements/ (not duplicated)
- Design Deliveries (DD-XXX.yaml) package complete flows for BMM handoff
- Iterative handoff model - hand off flows as they're ready

---

### 7.1 Chosen Approach: Methodology-First

**Order:**
1. Define the methodology (phases, outputs, connections)
2. Create workflows that implement the methodology
3. Create agents that guide users through workflows
4. Create examples that demonstrate the methodology

**Reasoning:**
- The methodology IS the product
- Agents serve the methodology, not vice versa
- User is crystal clear on the workflow (already proven in WPS2C v4)
- Not inventing new process, porting existing one

### 7.2 Detailed Order

#### Phase 1: Define the Methodology
| Order | Component | File | Status |
|-------|-----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Method Overview | `docs/method/wds-method-guide.md` | ✅ COMPLETE |

| 7 | Phase 6 Guide | `docs/method/phase-6-PRD-Finalization-guide.md` | ✅ COMPLETE |

**Methodology Phase Complete!** All phase guides refined with:
- Positive language throughout (no "expensive problems", "kills projects", etc.)
- Phase titles with artifacts in parentheses
- Removed duration estimates (project-dependent)
- Feature Impact Analysis with scoring system (Phase 2)
- Step 4E: PRD Update during design (Phase 4)
- Design System as optional parallel workflow (Phase 5)
- PRD Finalization with continuous handoff model (Phase 6)
- Unified naming conventions for Figma/Code integration
- Code examples moved to templates/examples (not in guides)

This serves as both documentation and inspiration for users.

**Trigger Mapping Workshop (Standalone):**
Create a standalone Trigger Mapping workshop that can be used:
- In WDS as part of Phase 2
- In BMM as a brainstorming/strategic alignment session
- In any project needing user-business alignment

This makes the Trigger Mapping methodology available even in projects not driven by designers. Could be contributed to BMM's brainstorming workflows or CIS (Creative Intelligence Suite).

Includes:
- Workshop facilitation workflow
- Agent instructions for running the workshop
- Template for Trigger Map output
- Integration points with BMM workflows

## 10. Reference Information

### 10.1 Open Design Decisions

**To resolve during porting Phase 1 & 2:**

| Decision | Options | Resolve When |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **ICP/Positioning placement** | Phase 1 as hypothesis → Phase 2 validates, OR fully in Phase 2 | Porting Phase 1-2 |
| **Prioritization Reasoning** | Formal step with output, OR internal thinking process | Porting Phase 2 |
| **Business Goals flow** | Initial in Brief → Refined in Trigger Map, OR single location | Porting Phase 1-2 |

**Context:** The Trigger Mapping (Effect Mapping) methodology is very strong. The prioritization reasoning step (column-by-column) is specifically valuable for generating product ideas but may not need formal documentation.

---

### 10.2 Product Positioning Framework

To be included in WDS workflows (stored in memory, ID: 11785915):

**Positioning Statement Format:**
```
For (target customer)
Who (statement of need or opportunity)
And want (statement of experience expectations)
The (product/service name)
Is (product category)
That (statement of key benefits)
Unlike (primary competitive alternative)
Our product (statement of primary differentiators)
```

**ICP Framework (8 Components):**
1. My ICP (Who I Serve Best)
2. My Positioning (How I'm Different)
3. The Outcomes I Drive
4. My Offerings (What I Sell)
5. Social Proof (Who Can Vouch)
6. My Frameworks/Models/Tools (How I Work)
7. The Pains My ICP Articulates (Triggers/Frustrations)
8. Pricing Anchoring (Cost of Inaction, Bad Hire, % Revenue, Speed)

**CTA Elements:**
- Website link
- Discovery call link
- Newsletter subscription
- Social follows
- Events attending

## Conversation Summary

### Key Discussion Points

1. **Fork vs Standalone:** Decided on fork for maximum adoption
2. **Module Name:** Whiteport Design Studio (WDS) to preserve brand
3. **Branch Strategy:** Work on main, switch to feature branches after adoption
4. **Folder Structure:** A-B-C-D-E alphabetical prefix for visual namespace
5. **Phase Approach:** Phase-selectable (not rigid tracks)
6. **Scope:** Design only, no development/backlog (handled by BMM)
7. **E-UI-Roadmap:** Integration bridge to development modules
8. **Development Order:** Methodology-first approach
9. **Language Style:** Soft, collaborative (not MUST/FORBIDDEN)
10. **Teaching Style:** Show, don't tell (examples over rules)

### User's Stated Experience

- WPS2C v4 works well, proven methodology
- Strong language (MUST/FORBIDDEN) makes agents ignore instructions
- Softer language gets better compliance
- Examples work better than rules
- Agents tend to question-dump (20 questions at once)
- Output format inconsistency is a problem

### Design Philosophy Established

1. Soft language by design
2. Show, don't tell (examples over explanations)
3. Example projects for adoption/training
4. Identity-based agent personas
5. Conversation examples showing dialog flow

## 12. Latest Updates (December 5, 2025)

### Phase 4 Workflow - Dog Week Pattern Implementation ✅

#### Phase 4 Architecture (December 4)

**Step-File Architecture:**
- `workflows/4-ux-design/workflow.yaml` - Main workflow configuration
- `workflows/4-ux-design/workflow.md` - Workflow orchestrator
- `workflows/4-ux-design/steps/step-01-init.md` - Workflow initialization
- `workflows/4-ux-design/steps/step-02-define-scenario.md` - Scenario structure
- `workflows/4-ux-design/steps/step-03-design-page.md` - Page design orchestration
- `workflows/4-ux-design/steps/step-04-complete-scenario.md` - Scenario completion
- `workflows/4-ux-design/steps/step-05-next-steps.md` - Next actions

**4C Micro-Steps (Specification Breakdown):**
- `substeps/4c-01-page-basics.md` - Page basic information
- `substeps/4c-02-layout-sections.md` - Layout sections definition
- `substeps/4c-03-components-objects.md` - Components & objects identification
- `substeps/4c-04-content-languages.md` - Content & language specs
- `substeps/4c-05-interactions.md` - Interaction definitions
- `substeps/4c-06-states.md` - Object states
- `substeps/4c-07-validation.md` - Validation rules
- `substeps/4c-08-generate-spec.md` - Final spec generation

#### Dog Week Pattern Implementation (December 5)

**Purpose-Based Text Organization:**
- `object-types/heading-text.md` - Updated with purpose-based naming
- `object-types/object-router.md` - Enhanced with intelligent interpretation
- Text objects named by FUNCTION, not content (e.g., `start-hero-headline` not `welcome-text`)
- Structure (position/style) separated from content
- Translations grouped so each language reads coherently

**Sketch Text Analysis:**
- Horizontal line detection → text placeholders
- Line thickness → font size estimation
- Line spacing → line-height calculation
- Character capacity estimation for content validation
- `SKETCH-TEXT-ANALYSIS-GUIDE.md` - Complete analysis methodology

**Translation Grouping:**
- Text groups keep languages together
- Each language reads as complete, coherent message
- Dog Week format standardized across all projects
- `TRANSLATION-ORGANIZATION-GUIDE.md` - Complete translation pattern
- `DOG-WEEK-SPECIFICATION-PATTERN.md` - Full workflow integration example

**Object Type Instructions:**
- `object-types/button.md` - Button documentation
- `object-types/text-input.md` - Text input fields
- `object-types/link.md` - Link elements
- `object-types/heading-text.md` - Headings & text with placeholder analysis
- `object-types/image.md` - Image elements
- `object-types/object-router.md` - Intelligent object detection & routing

**Design Principles Applied:**
- ✅ Goal-based trust-the-agent approach
- ✅ Concise instructions (vs. long procedural lists)
- ✅ Soft, collaborative language throughout
- ✅ Clear step separation with micro-steps
- ✅ Optional steps where appropriate
- ✅ v6 best practices for instruction file sizing
- ✅ Purpose-based naming (stable Object IDs)
- ✅ Grouped translations (coherent reading)
- ✅ Character capacity validation from sketches

**Key Innovations:**
1. **Purpose-Based Object IDs** - IDs reflect function, remain stable when content changes
2. **Grouped Translations** - Each language reads coherently as a group
3. **Sketch Text Analysis** - Automatic capacity estimation from visual markers
4. **Intelligent Routing** - Agent suggests object types rather than asking lists

**Architecture Documentation:**
- `workflows/4-ux-design/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete Phase 4 architecture
- `workflows/4-ux-design/SKETCH-TEXT-ANALYSIS-GUIDE.md` - Text analysis methodology
- `workflows/4-ux-design/TRANSLATION-ORGANIZATION-GUIDE.md` - Translation patterns
- `workflows/4-ux-design/DOG-WEEK-SPECIFICATION-PATTERN.md` - Complete workflow example

**Next Actions:**
- Create Phase 5 workflow (Design System)
- Create Phase 6 workflow (PRD Finalization / Dev Integration)
- Complete agent definitions (Freyja, Baldr)
- Port agent presentations
- Create remaining object-type instruction files (~15 more types)

#### Language Configuration (December 5 - Later)

**Multi-Language Support:**
- `workflows/workflow-init/instructions.md` - Updated with language configuration (Step 4)
- `workflows/wds-workflow-status-template.yaml` - Added language fields to config
- `workflows/LANGUAGE-CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md` - Complete multi-language guide
- `workflows/LANGUAGE-FLOW-DIAGRAM.md` - Step-by-step language flow

**Configuration Settings:**
1. **Specification Language** - Language to write design specs in (EN, SE, etc.)
2. **Product Languages** - Array of languages the product supports

**Storage:**
```yaml
config:
  specification_language: "EN"
  product_languages:
    - EN
    - SE
    - NO
```

**Impact on Workflows:**
- Specs written in `specification_language`
- All text objects include translations for ALL `product_languages`
- Agents automatically request content for each configured language
- Complete translation coverage from day one

**Example (Dog Week):**
- Specification Language: EN (specs written in English)
- Product Languages: [EN, SE] (product supports English & Swedish)
- Result: All text objects have both EN and SE content

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Flexible spec language separate from product languages
- ✅ All translations grouped and coherent
- ✅ No missing translations
- ✅ Developer-friendly config
- ✅ Easy to add languages mid-project

#### Sketch Text Analysis Corrections (December 5 - Final)

**Corrected Understanding:**
- **Line thickness** → **font weight** (bold/regular), NOT font size!
- **Distance between lines** → **font size**
- **Confusion risk:** Large spacing (>60px) might be image/colored box, not text

**Updated Files:**
- `4-ux-design/object-types/heading-text.md` - Corrected analysis logic
- `4-ux-design/SKETCH-TEXT-ANALYSIS-GUIDE.md` - Updated with correct interpretation
- `4-ux-design/SKETCH-TEXT-QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - Quick reference card
- `4-ux-design/SKETCH-TEXT-STRATEGY.md` - When to use text vs. markers

**Best Practice - Actual Text vs. Markers:**

**Use ACTUAL TEXT for:**
- Headlines (provides content guidance)
- Button labels (shows intended action)
- Navigation items (clarifies structure)
- Short, important text

**Use LINE MARKERS for:**
- Body paragraphs (content TBD)
- Long descriptions (sizing only)
- Placeholder content

**Agent Behavior:**
- Reads actual text from sketch as starting suggestion
- **Proactively suggests translations for all configured languages**
- Allows refinement during specification
- Sketch text isn't final, just guidance
- Analyzes markers for font size, weight, capacity

**Example:**
```
Every walk. on time.  ← Agent reads this
Every time.           ← Translates to all languages

EN: Every walk. on time. Every time.
SE: Varje promenad. i tid. Varje gång.  ← Agent suggests!

Do these work? [1] Use [2] Adjust [3] Manual
```

**User can:**
- Accept suggestions (fast!)
- Refine specific translations
- Provide manual input if preferred

## 15. Design System Architecture (December 9, 2025)

### 15.1 Core Principles

**Three-Way Split Architecture:**

```
1. Page Specification (Logical View)
   ├── Component references
   ├── Page-specific content (labels, error texts)
   ├── Layout/structure
   └── WHY this page exists

2. Design System (Visual/Component Library)
   ├── Component definitions
   ├── States & variants
   ├── Styling/tokens
   └── Reusable patterns

3. Functionality/Storyboards (Behavior)
   ├── Interactions
   ├── State transitions
   ├── User flows
   └── Component behaviors
```

**Key Separation:**
- **Specification = Content** (what the component is)
- **Organization = Structure** (where it lives)
- **Design System = Optional** (chosen in Phase 1)

### 15.2 Design System Options

**Three Modes (Chosen in Project Exploration):**

**Option A: No Design System**
- Components stay page-specific
- AI/dev team handles consistency
- Faster for simple projects

**Option B: Custom Design System**
- Designer defines in Figma
- Components extracted as discovered
- Figma MCP endpoints for integration

**Option C: Component Library Design System**
- Uses shadcn/Radix/etc.
- Library chosen during setup
- Components mapped to library defaults

### 15.3 Component Flow with Design System

**Complete Specification → Extract → Reference:**

```
1. Specification Component (Pure)
   └── Captures EVERYTHING about object (mixed content)

2. Orchestration Layer
   ├── Receives complete specification
   ├── Design system enabled?
   │
   └── YES → Design System Router
       ├── A. Extract component-level info
       ├── B. Add/update design system entry
       ├── C. Create reference ID
       ├── D. Return to page spec
       ├── E. Replace component info with reference
       └── F. Keep only page-specific info

3. Result: Clean separation
   ├── Page spec: References + page-specific content
   └── Design system: Component definitions
```

**Example:**

**Complete Specification:**
```yaml
Login Button:
  why: Submit login credentials
  label: "Log in"                    # Page-specific
  error_text: "Invalid credentials"  # Page-specific
  states: [default, hover, disabled] # Component-level
  variants: [primary, secondary]     # Component-level
  styling: {...}                     # Component-level
```

**After Split:**

**Design System:**
```yaml
# D-Design-System/components/button.md
Button Component [btn-001]:
  states: [default, hover, disabled]
  variants: [primary, secondary]
  styling: {...}
```

**Page Spec:**
```yaml
# C-Scenarios/login-page.md
Login Button:
  component: Button.primary [btn-001]  # Reference
  why: Submit login credentials
  label: "Log in"
  error_text: "Invalid credentials"
```

### 15.4 Design System Router

**Parallel to Sketch Router:**

```
Design System Router
├── Check: Does similar component exist?
│
├── NO → Route to: Create New Component
│   └── Add to design system, create reference
│
└── YES → Route to: Opportunity/Risk Assessment
    ├── Scan existing components
    ├── Compare attributes
    ├── Calculate similarity
    ├── Identify opportunities
    ├── Identify risks
    ├── Present decision to designer
    └── Execute decision:
        ├── Same → Reuse reference
        ├── Variant → Add variant to existing
        └── New → Create new component
```

**Router Characteristics:**
- Dumb and simple (just identify and route)
- Doesn't contain business logic
- Keeps orchestration clean
- Parallel pattern to sketch router

### 15.5 Opportunity/Risk Assessment

**Micro-Instruction Breakdown:**

```
workflows/5-design-system/assessment/
├── 01-scan-existing.md           # Find similar components
├── 02-compare-attributes.md      # Compare systematically
├── 03-calculate-similarity.md    # Score the match
├── 04-identify-opportunities.md  # What could we gain?
├── 05-identify-risks.md          # What could go wrong?
├── 06-present-decision.md        # Show designer options
└── 07-execute-decision.md        # Implement choice
```

**Example Conversation:**
```
Agent: "I found a button similar to btn-001 (Primary Button).

Similarities:
- Same size and shape
- Same color scheme
- Same hover behavior

Differences:
- Different label ('Continue' vs 'Submit')
- Different icon (arrow vs checkmark)

Options:
[1] Same component (just change label/icon)
[2] New variant of btn-001 (add 'continue' variant)
[3] New component btn-002 (different purpose)

If variant:
✅ Pros: Consistency, easier maintenance
❌ Cons: More complex component

If separate:
✅ Pros: Independence, flexibility
❌ Cons: Potential inconsistency

What's your call?"
```

**Key Insight:** Design systems are inherently challenging. WDS acknowledges risks and creates conversation points for designer judgment.

### 15.6 Layered Knowledge Architecture

**Centralized Concepts + Component-Specific Instructions:**

```
Core Principles (Shared)
├── data/design-system/
│   ├── token-architecture.md      # Structure vs style separation
│   ├── naming-conventions.md      # Token naming rules
│   ├── state-management.md        # Component states
│   └── validation-patterns.md     # Form validation
│
└── Referenced by component types

↓

Component-Type Instructions (Specific)
├── object-types/text-heading.md
│   ├── References: token-architecture.md
│   ├── References: naming-conventions.md
│   └── Heading-specific rules
│
├── object-types/button.md
│   ├── References: token-architecture.md
│   ├── References: state-management.md
│   └── Button-specific rules
│
└── object-types/input-field.md
    ├── References: token-architecture.md
    ├── References: validation-patterns.md
    └── Input-specific rules
```

**Benefits:**
- Small, digestible instruction files
- Shared knowledge in one place
- Selective loading (only what's needed)
- Composable knowledge
- Easy to maintain and update

**Example: Structure vs Style Separation**

**Shared Principle (`data/design-system/token-architecture.md`):**
```markdown
# Design Token Architecture

## Core Principle
Separate semantic structure from visual style.

HTML defines meaning, tokens define appearance.

<h2> = Semantic (second-level heading)
"Display Large" = Visual (48px, bold, tight spacing)

They should be independent!
```

**Component Application (`object-types/text-heading.md`):**
```markdown
# Text Heading Specification

**References:** data/design-system/token-architecture.md

## Heading-Specific Rules
1. Identify semantic level (h1-h6)
2. Map to design token (display-large, heading-1, etc.)
3. Never mix structure with style
4. Store structure in page spec
5. Store style in design system tokens
```

### 15.7 Company Customization Model

**Key Feature: Companies Can Fork WDS**

```
Company forks WDS
├── Keeps: Core workflow architecture
├── Keeps: Router logic
├── Keeps: Orchestration patterns
│
└── Customizes:
    ├── data/design-system/
    │   ├── token-architecture.md    # Company standards
    │   ├── naming-conventions.md    # Company naming
    │   └── brand-guidelines.md      # Company brand
    │
    └── object-types/
        ├── button.md                # Company button patterns
        ├── input-field.md           # Company form standards
        └── card.md                  # Company card patterns
```

**Use Cases:**

**1. Enterprise with Design System**
```
Acme Corp forks WDS:
├── Adds: data/design-system/acme-tokens.md
├── Adds: data/design-system/acme-components.md
└── Customizes: object-types/ to match Acme patterns

Result: Every project uses Acme standards automatically
```

**2. Agency with Multiple Clients**
```
Agency forks WDS:
├── Branch: client-a (Client A standards)
├── Branch: client-b (Client B standards)
└── Branch: main (Agency defaults)

Result: Switch branch = switch standards
```

**3. Design System Team**
```
Design System Team forks WDS:
├── Adds: Their component library specs
├── Adds: Their token architecture
└── Adds: Their validation rules

Result: All designers use same system
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Company-specific standards
- ✅ Version controlled
- ✅ Shareable across teams
- ✅ Evolvable over time
- ✅ Consistent across projects
- ✅ Open-source dream: Customize without breaking core

### 15.8 Design System Workflow Structure

**Planned Structure:**

```
workflows/5-design-system/
├── workflow.yaml                      # Main workflow entry
├── design-system-router.md            # Router logic
│
├── assessment/                        # Opportunity/Risk micro-instructions
│   ├── 01-scan-existing.md
│   ├── 02-compare-attributes.md
│   ├── 03-calculate-similarity.md
│   ├── 04-identify-opportunities.md
│   ├── 05-identify-risks.md
│   ├── 06-present-decision.md
│   └── 07-execute-decision.md
│
├── operations/                        # Design system operations
│   ├── create-new-component.md
│   ├── add-variant.md
│   ├── update-component.md
│   └── initialize-design-system.md
│
└── templates/                         # Output templates
    ├── component.template.md
    ├── design-tokens.template.md
    └── component-library-config.template.md
```

**Integration Points:**
- Called from Phase 4 orchestration (4c-03-components-objects.md)
- Triggered after component specification
- Only active if design system enabled in project
- First component triggers initialization

### 15.9 Key Risks Identified

**1. Component Matching**
- How to recognize "same" vs "similar" vs "different"
- Solution: Similarity scoring + designer judgment

**2. Circular References**
- Page → Component → Functionality → Component
- Solution: Clear hierarchy (Page → Component → Functionality)

**3. Sync Problems**
- Component evolves, references may break
- Solution: Reference IDs + update notifications

**4. Component Boundaries**
- Icon in button? Nested components?
- Solution: Designer conversation + guidelines

**5. First Component**
- When to initialize design system?
- Solution: Auto-initialize on first component if enabled

**6. Storyboard Granularity**
- Component behavior vs page flow
- Solution: Clear separation guidelines

**Mitigation Strategy:**
- AI identifies risks
- Designer makes judgment calls
- AI executes decisions
- Transparent process with pros/cons

## 19. Future: Dogweek Design System Refactoring (Backlog)

**Purpose:** Use Dogweek as live case study to validate WDS Phase 5

**Identified Issues in Dogweek:**
1. **Button Proliferation:** 8 separate button files (should be 1 component with variants)
2. **Structure/Style Confusion:** H1 component hardcoded to visual style (breaks semantic HTML)
3. **No Token Architecture:** Hardcoded values instead of design tokens
4. **No Component IDs:** File-based organization, no usage tracking
5. **No Similarity Detection:** Manual component management

**Proposed Refactoring:**
- Consolidate 8 button files → 1 Button component [btn-001] with variants
- Separate semantic HTML (h1-h6) from visual tokens (heading-hero, heading-page)
- Implement design token system (colors, typography, spacing)
- Add component IDs and usage tracking
- Create component references in page specs

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Validates WDS Phase 5 on production system
- ✅ Improves Dogweek maintainability
- ✅ Creates migration guide for other projects
- ✅ Generates real-world examples for WDS course

**Status:** Backlog (after Phase 6 complete)

### Persona Highlights

**Identity:**
```yaml
I'm Saga, the goddess of stories and wisdom. I help you discover and articulate 
your product's strategic narrative - transforming vague ideas into clear, 
actionable foundations.

I treat analysis like a treasure hunt - excited by every clue, thrilled when 
patterns emerge.
```

**Communication Style:**
```yaml
I ask questions that spark 'aha!' moments while structuring insights with precision.

My approach is collaborative - we build documents together, not through interrogation. 
I ask one question at a time and listen deeply to your answer.

Analysis should feel like coffee with a wise mentor, not a survey or audit.
```

**Working Rhythm:**
```yaml
When we work together:
1. I ask something interesting
2. You share your thinking
3. I reflect it back to show I'm listening
4. Together we discover something new
5. I structure it into clear documentation
```

### Menu Structure

**Primary WDS Workflows:**
1. `workflow-status` - Initialize or check WDS project status (entry point)
2. `project-brief` - Phase 1: Product Exploration (Product Brief)
3. `trigger-mapping` - Phase 2: Trigger Mapping (User Psychology)

**Supporting Workflows:**
4. `brainstorm-project` - Guided brainstorming for vision exploration
5. `research` - Market, domain, competitive, or technical research
6. `document-project` - Document existing brownfield projects

**Collaboration Features:**
7. `party-mode` - Multi-agent collaboration
8. `expert-chat` - Direct conversation with Saga

### Design Philosophy Implementation

**✅ Soft Language:**
- No "MUST", "FORBIDDEN", "NEVER" commands
- Identity-based guidance instead of rules
- Collaborative framing throughout

**✅ Show, Don't Tell:**
- Working rhythm examples provided
- Clear "what works well" vs "what feels less collaborative"
- Concrete process visualization

**✅ Norse Mythology Theme:**
- Saga = Goddess of stories and wisdom
- Fits perfectly with role (discovering product stories)
- Creates memorable WDS brand identity
- Explained in presentation for user understanding

### Integration Points

### Files Created

1. `src/modules/wds/agents/saga-analyst.agent.yaml` (102 lines)
2. `src/modules/wds/data/presentations/saga-intro.md` (280+ lines)

### Files Modified

1. `WDS-V6-CONVERSION-ROADMAP.md` - Updated agent status tables, folder structure sync

### Key Decisions Made

**Agent Naming:**
- **Saga WDS Analyst** (not Mary, not just "Business Analyst")
- Norse mythology theme for unique WDS identity
- "Saga the Analyst" format - natural reading, clear function

**Capability Scope:**
- Phases 1-2 focus (Product Brief, Trigger Map)
- Strategic foundation and market intelligence
- Replaces BMM analyst when WDS is chosen
- Maintains BMM analyst capabilities (research, documentation)

**Language Style:**
- Soft, collaborative, identity-based
- Working rhythm explicitly defined
- "What works well" vs "what feels less collaborative" framing
- No harsh enforcement language

**Integration Strategy:**
- Seamless with WDS workflows (phases 1-2)
- Leverages BMM workflows (research, documentation)
- Uses core workflows (brainstorming, party-mode)
- Bridges to development via E-Design-Deliveries

## 11. Future Enhancement Ideas

### Pitch Module (Phase 0: Consultant Pitch & Discovery)

**Status:** Concept - Not yet implemented

**Purpose:** Help consultants create compelling pitches to win WDS engagements

**Approach:** Two-repo strategy (no complexity in client projects)
- **Client repo:** Standard WDS phases (A-G folders)
- **Consultant repo:** Private pitch materials (pricing, strategy, proposals)

**What it would include:**

```
src/modules/wds/
├── workflows/
│   └── 0-pitch/              # Pitch workflow
│       ├── workflow.md
│       └── steps/
│           ├── step-01-discovery.md
│           ├── step-02-analysis.md
│           ├── step-03-recommendation.md
│           ├── step-04-pitch-deck.md
│           └── step-05-proposal.md
│
└── reference/
    └── pitch/                # Pitch templates
        ├── pitch-deck-template.md
        ├── proposal-template.md
        ├── pricing-calculator.md
        └── discovery-questions.md
```

**Agent:** Saga the WDS Analyst (natural fit for discovery)

**Trigger:** `pitch-client` - Creates pitch materials with consultant-specified output location

**Key Features:**
- Client research and discovery
- Phase recommendation (which WDS phases client needs)
- Effort estimation and timeline
- Pitch deck content generation
- Scope proposal creation
- Pricing/budget guidance

**Security Model:**
- Consultant controls where files are saved (their private repo)
- No `.consultant/` folder or gitignore complexity
- Clean separation between client and consultant materials
- Works with any organizational system

**Deliverables:**
- Client discovery notes
- Recommended WDS phases
- Pitch deck content
- Scope proposal
- Timeline and effort estimates
- Budget/pricing strategy

**Benefits:**
- Helps consultants win engagements
- Standardizes pitch process
- Ensures proper WDS scoping
- Maintains confidentiality
- Reusable across clients

**Implementation Priority:** Low (optional enhancement after core WDS is stable)
