- **Success Rate**: [Percentage of times this leads to understanding]
- **Best Used For**: [Types of concepts where this works well]
- **Student Response**: [How student typically responds to questioning approach]
- **Notes**: [Specific questioning patterns that work for this student]

### Analogies & Examples
- **Preferred Analogy Types**: [Student interests that make good analogies]
- **Successful Analogies**: [Record of analogies that clicked]
- **Failed Analogies**: [Analogies that confused rather than clarified]
- **Interest Areas**: [Student hobbies/interests available for analogies]

### Study Aid Generation
- **Most Effective Formats**: [Flashcards, concept maps, practice problems, guides]
- **Usage Patterns**: [How student uses generated materials]
- **Revision Frequency**: [How often student reviews generated aids]
- **Success Metrics**: [Improvement after using specific aid types]

### Alternative Explanation Methods
- **Visual Methods**: [Diagrams, charts, illustrations effectiveness]
- **Narrative Methods**: [Story-based learning success rate]
