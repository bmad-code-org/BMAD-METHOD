# TODO-001 Investigation Report: Locating the Problematic File

## Status: ⚠️ Issue Not Found in Current Codebase

### Files Searched:

1. ✅ `c:\Users\kdejo\DEV\bmad-v6\bmad\core\agents\bmad-master.md` - Found, examined
2. ✅ `c:\Users\kdejo\DEV\bmad-v6\src\core\agents\bmad-master.agent.yaml` - Found, examined (YAML format)
3. ✅ `.claude\commands\bmad\core\agents\bmad-master.md` - Found (duplicate)

### Search Results:

- ❌ **No instances of `Dependencies map to root/type/name` found**
- ❌ **No instances of `root/type/name` pattern found**
- ❌ **No IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION documentation found**
- ❌ **Line 14 in bmad-master.md does not contain dependency mapping**

### Current bmad-master.md Content (Line 14):

```xml
  <step n="4">Load into memory {project-root}/bmad/core/config.yaml and set variable project_name, output_folder, user_name, communication_language</step>
```

**This line uses proper variable interpolation syntax: `{project-root}`**

## Investigation Findings:

### 1. Path Resolution Logic Found:

- **File**: `tools/cli/installers/lib/core/dependency-resolver.js`
- **Function**: `parseFileReferences()` and `resolveSingleDependency()`
- **Status**: ✅ **Already uses correct `{project-root}` syntax**

### 2. Variable Interpolation Patterns:

Throughout the codebase, I found consistent use of:

- ✅ `{project-root}` - Correctly used everywhere
- ✅ `{user_name}` - Properly formatted variables
- ✅ `{communication_language}` - Proper syntax

### 3. Dependency Resolution Code Analysis:

```javascript
// From dependency-resolver.js line 295+
if (depPath.includes('{project-root}')) {
  // Remove {project-root} and resolve as bmad path
  depPath = depPath.replace('{project-root}', '');
  // ... proper resolution logic
}
```

**✅ Code correctly handles variable interpolation with curly braces**

## Hypothesis: Issue Status

### Possible Scenarios:

1. **🎯 Issue Already Fixed**: The bug may have been fixed in a previous commit
2. **🔄 Different Branch**: Issue exists on a different branch (main vs v6-alpha)
3. **📁 Different File**: Issue is in a file we haven't found yet
4. **🏷️ Different Version**: Issue reporter was using an older version

### Next Actions:

1. **Check commit history** for previous fixes to dependency resolution
2. **Search main branch** to see if issue exists there
3. **Search for any file containing IDE-FILE-RESOLUTION**
4. **Look for workflow.xml or similar files** that might contain the problematic syntax

## Updated TODO Status:

- ✅ **TODO-001.1**: Found bmad-master.md files
- ❌ **TODO-001.2**: Line 14 does NOT contain problematic syntax
- ✅ **TODO-001.3**: Documented current behavior (uses correct syntax)

## Recommendation:

**Either the issue has already been resolved, or we need to investigate further to find where the `root/type/name` syntax actually exists in the codebase.**
