# Recommendation Draft for PR #821

Date: 2025-10-28
Branch: pr-821-review

## Summary

PR #821 contributes a comprehensive, self-contained subagent system for Claude and OpenCode. It is technically clean to add but represents a different architectural philosophy (static, editor-focused agents) than BMAD v6 (dynamic, template-driven, CLI-oriented).

## Recommended Path

- Primary: Reference as an external alternative (Option 3)
  - Rationale: Avoid dual systems; respect contributor's broader toolkit; zero maintenance burden
  - Action: Add docs section linking to agentic-toolkit with caveats and positioning
- Secondary: Extract patterns for v6 dynamic generation (Option 2)
  - Rationale: Improve BMAD agents using proven command principles and optimization
  - Action: Spike adapter for 1â€“2 agents to validate mapping to `*.agent.yaml`
- Optional: Consider shipping the 3-step Simple workflow (Option 4)
  - Rationale: Clear value, small scope, minimal confusion
  - Action: Convert `1-create-prd`, `2-generate-tasks`, `3-process-task-list` into BMAD YAML agents under a new minimal module

## Closeout Note (for PR)

Thank the contributor, acknowledge the quality and completeness of the subagent system, and explain the architectural alignment decision. Offer to collaborate on extracting optimization patterns into BMAD and to highlight the external toolkit as a recommended quick-start for users who prefer static/editor-first agents.
