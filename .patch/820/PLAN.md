  2. Activate Agent with "hello" prompt
  3. Execute Commands with /bmad prefix
- Examples showing /agents and /bmad/bmm/workflows/workflow-init
- Notes about Tab navigation and command autocomplete
```

**Key Features:**

- Clear, concise instructions for users
- Examples of agent switching and command execution
- Notes about fuzzy matching for commands
- Follows same documentation pattern as other IDEs

### 2. **NEW: tools/cli/installers/lib/ide/opencode.js** (134 lines added)

**Purpose:** OpenCode IDE setup handler - main implementation

**Architecture:**

```
OpenCodeSetup extends BaseIdeSetup
  ├── constructor()
  │   ├── super('opencode', 'OpenCode', false)
  │   ├── this.configDir = '.opencode'
  │   ├── this.commandsDir = 'command'
  │   └── this.agentsDir = 'agent'
  │
  ├── async setup(projectDir, bmadDir, options = {})
  │   ├── Creates .opencode/agent/bmad/{module} directories
  │   ├── Creates .opencode/command/bmad/{module} directories
  │   ├── Installs agents using getAgentsFromBmad()
  │   ├── Generates workflow commands using WorkflowCommandGenerator
  │   └── Returns { success: true, agents: count, workflows: count }
  │
  ├── async readAndProcess(filePath, metadata)
  │   └── Reads and processes agent files
  │
  ├── createAgentContent(content, metadata)
  │   ├── Parses frontmatter
  │   ├── Sets description: "BMAD {module} agent: {name}"
  │   ├── Sets mode: 'primary' for OpenCode
  │   └── Rebuilds frontmatter YAML
  │
  ├── parseFrontmatter(content)
  │   ├── Extracts YAML frontmatter from agent files
  │   └── Returns { frontmatter, body }
  │
  └── stringifyFrontmatter(frontmatter)
      └── Serializes frontmatter back to YAML format
```

**Key Features:**

- Extends BaseIdeSetup for consistency with other IDEs
- Detects opencode command directory
- Installs agents with proper frontmatter (required for OpenCode)
- Generates workflow commands from BMAD workflow templates
- Sets `mode: 'primary'` for OpenCode agent recognition
- Adds default descriptions if missing
- Proper YAML serialization with 2-space indent

**Dependencies:**

- `BaseIdeSetup` - Base class for IDE setup handlers
- `WorkflowCommandGenerator` - Generates workflow commands
- `getAgentsFromBmad()` - Retrieves BMAD agents
- fs-extra, chalk, yaml, path modules

### 3. **MODIFIED: tools/cli/README.md** (3 lines added, 1 deleted)

**Changes:**

```diff
- Updated OpenCode entry in IDE list
- Added OpenCode to installation options documentation
- Reflects OpenCode as a supported IDE in tools/cli subsystem
```

**Impact:** Minimal - documentation update only

### 4. **MODIFIED: tools/cli/installers/lib/core/detector.js** (5 lines added, 1 deleted)

**Changes:**

```diff
+ Added OpenCode command directory detection
- Removed obsolete detection logic
```

**Purpose:** Detect if OpenCode is installed via `opencode` command

**Detection Logic:**

- Checks for `opencode` command in system PATH
- Determines `.opencode` configuration directory
- Allows installer to detect pre-existing OpenCode setup

### 5. **MODIFIED: tools/cli/installers/lib/ide/workflow-command-template.md** (4 lines added)

**Changes:**

```diff
+ Added frontmatter with description field
- Maintained backward compatibility with other IDEs
```

**Purpose:** Add YAML frontmatter to workflow command templates

**New Frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
description: 'BMAD Workflow Command'
---
```

**Note:** This frontmatter is required by OpenCode for command recognition. The update is backward compatible - it doesn't impact other IDEs, as other IDE setup handlers strip or adapt frontmatter as needed.

### 6. **MODIFIED: tools/platform-codes.yaml** (6 lines added)

**Changes:**

```diff
+ Added opencode platform code entry
  name: "OpenCode"
  preferred: false
  category: ide
  description: "OpenCode terminal coding assistant"
```

**Purpose:** Register OpenCode as a valid platform code

**Impact:**

- Adds OpenCode to platform registry
- Marks as non-preferred (users can select but not auto-selected)
- Categorized as IDE
- Clear description for users

### 7. **MODIFIED: src/modules/bmm/workflows/workflow-status/workflow.yaml** (2 lines modified)

**Changes:**

```diff
- description: "Workflow status and execution tracking"
+ description: "Workflow status and execution tracking (escaped for templates)"
```

**Purpose:** Properly escape quotes when interpolated in OpenCode templates

**Technical Detail:**

- YAML description field may contain special characters
- When interpolated in template strings, must be properly escaped
- Prevents template interpolation errors
- Ensures OpenCode template rendering works correctly

## 🔍 Known Considerations

### 1. **Frontmatter Requirement**

- OpenCode requires frontmatter in command/agent files
- This PR adds frontmatter template to workflow-command-template.md
- Backward compatible - other IDEs handle frontmatter appropriately

### 2. **Quote Escaping**

- workflow.yaml description updated to handle template interpolation
- Prevents errors when description contains quotes
- Applies to all IDEs, improves robustness

### 3. **Directory Detection**

- Detector checks for `opencode` command availability
- Assumes `.opencode` is standard config directory
- Standard for OpenCode installations
