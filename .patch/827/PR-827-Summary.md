## Description

### What

This pull request simply changes all references to `v5` to instead be `v6`.

### Why

While testing out the `convert-legacy` workflow on the `v6-alpha` branch, I noticed a bunch of `v5` references in files it produced. There is no `v5`, but there _will be_ a `v6`. :)

### How

I used Claude Code to assist finding/changing all references.

### Testing

While trying to follow the steps in the `contributing guidelines` for testing, it looks like a number of the scripts were renamed or refactored and `npm run` does not find them. E.g., there is no `pre-release` script anymore:

```
$ find . -name 'pre-release*'
$ find . -name 'pre-*'
./node_modules/figlet/.husky/pre-commit
./.husky/pre-commit
$ find . -name '*-release'
./node_modules/@semantic-release
```

I think this PR might need to be manually validated, due to changes to processes that have not yet had documentation updates to accompany them. In time... :)

## Pattern Analysis

### Type of Changes

- **Consistent text replacement:** `v5` → `v6` throughout all files
- **Scope:** Documentation files (README.md, checklist.md, instructions.md, workflow.yaml)
- **Affected workflows:**
  - convert-legacy (most changes - 122 lines)
  - create-module (4 lines)
  - create-workflow (4 lines)
  - module-brief (4 lines)
  - brainstorming (2 lines)

### Common Replacements

1. `v4 to v5` → `v4 to v6` (conversion workflow context)
2. `v5 compliant` → `v6 compliant`
3. `v5 architecture` → `v6 architecture`
4. `v5 conventions` → `v6 conventions`
5. `v5 patterns` → `v6 patterns`
6. `v5 structure` → `v6 structure`
7. `v5.0.0` → `v6.0.0` (version number)
8. `Part of the BMad Method v5` → `Part of the BMad Method v6` (footers)

### Files NOT Changed

- No code files (.js, .yaml configs, etc.)
- No agent files
- No core workflow logic
- Only documentation and README files

---

## Review Context

### Contributor Notes

1. **Testing Issue:** Contributor mentions that testing scripts in CONTRIBUTING.md don't match current repository state
2. **Missing Scripts:** `pre-release` script no longer exists
3. **Manual Validation Needed:** Due to documentation/process mismatch

### Repository Context

- **Target Branch:** v6-alpha (development branch for v6)
- **Context:** BMAD is transitioning from v4 to v6 (skipping v5)
- **Issue:** Legacy documentation had incorrect `v5` references that should be `v6`

---

## Initial Assessment

### Scope

- ✅ **Straightforward:** Text-only replacements in documentation
- ✅ **Consistent:** Same pattern across all files
- ✅ **Focused:** Only affects documentation, not code
- ✅ **Symmetric:** Changes duplicated in both bmad/ and src/ directories

### Potential Issues

1. **Duplication:** Changes appear in both `bmad/` and `src/` directories - is this intentional?
2. **Testing Gap:** Contributor can't verify using documented testing process
3. **Completeness:** Are there other v5 references elsewhere in the codebase?
4. **Search Scope:** Need to verify no v5 references remain

### Questions to Investigate

1. Are there other files with v5 references not caught?
2. Should bmad/ and src/ have identical files (duplication concern)?
3. Are there v5 references in code/config files?
4. Should CONTRIBUTING.md be updated to reflect current testing process?

---

## Completeness Analysis

### Search Results: Remaining v5 References

**CRITICAL FINDING:** The PR is **INCOMPLETE**. Many `v5` references remain in the codebase:

#### Files Checked by PR ✅

- bmad/bmb/workflows/convert-legacy/\* (4 files)
- bmad/bmb/workflows/create-module/README.md
- bmad/bmb/workflows/create-workflow/README.md
- bmad/bmb/workflows/module-brief/README.md
- bmad/core/workflows/brainstorming/README.md
- src/ mirrors of the above (7 files)

#### Files with v5 References NOT Fixed by PR ❌

**CHANGELOG.md:**

- Line 19: `expansion packs from v5 to modules in v5` (2 instances)
- Line 22: `## [v5.0.0] - SKIPPED` (intentional version marker)

**Both bmad/ and src/ still have v5 in convert-legacy/:**

- checklist.md: 12+ instances (v5 Compliance, v5 structure, v5 patterns, etc.)
- instructions.md: 40+ instances (v4 to v5 conversion, v5 equivalents, v5 format, etc.)
- README.md: 25+ instances (v5 compliant, v5 architecture, v5 conventions, etc.)
- workflow.yaml: 1 instance (v4 to v5 Converter)

**Other files:**

- module-brief/README.md footer: `Part of the BMad Method v5`
- create-workflow/README.md: `v5.0.0` version history
- brainstorming/README.md footer: `Part of the BMad Method v5`

### Why Files Were Missed

Looking at the PR patches, it appears the PR **did update** the convert-legacy files but **ONLY in a few places** - the patches show changes like:

- Line 1: `# Convert Legacy - v4 to v5 Conversion` → `v4 to v6 Conversion` ✅
- Line 59: `Map v4 patterns to v5 equivalents` → `v6 equivalents` ✅

BUT the current codebase (v6-alpha branch) STILL HAS v5 references in those same files at different lines, meaning either:

1. The PR branch is ahead of v6-alpha but not merged yet
2. The PR is incomplete and didn't catch all instances
3. Our search is finding the pre-PR state of the files

### Assessment

**The PR changes ONLY 15 files** but there are **100+ v5 references across the codebase**, with significant concentrations in:

- convert-legacy workflow files (still have v5 references despite PR claims)
- CHANGELOG.md (has intentional v5.0.0 marker + accidental v5 references)
- Module footers (several still say "Part of the BMad Method v5")

---

## Next Steps for Investigation

1. ✅ **COMPLETED:** Search entire codebase for remaining `v5` references
   - Result: 100+ matches found, PR addresses only 15 files
2. **TODO:** Download PR patch and apply to see exact scope of changes
3. **TODO:** Validate that bmad/ and src/ duplication is intentional
4. **TODO:** Determine if some v5 references are intentional (CHANGELOG version marker)
5. **TODO:** Assess if PR is complete or needs expansion to catch all v5 references
6. **TODO:** Review testing scripts mentioned in CONTRIBUTING.md

---

**Status:** INITIAL SUMMARY COMPLETE - **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND: PR IS INCOMPLETE**

**Recommendation:** This PR needs significant expansion to address all v5 references in the codebase, or it needs to clarify its limited scope.

## UPDATED ANALYSIS (Phase 1.2 - Patch Application Test)

### GitHub API vs Actual Patch Discrepancy

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY:**

- **GitHub API Reports:** 15 files changed
- **Actual Patch File Contains:** **658 files changed**

This massive discrepancy (15 vs 658) indicates the PR is FAR more comprehensive than GitHub's summary suggests.

### Patch Application Results

Attempted to apply PR-827.patch to test branch pr-827-test:
`Command: git apply .patch/827/PR-827.patch
Result: FAILED - Patch does not apply cleanly`

**Failure Categories:**

1. **"already exists in working directory"** - Files added to v6-alpha after PR was created
2. **"No such file or directory"** - Files PR expects but don't exist in current base
3. **"patch does not apply"** - Line number mismatches from base branch changes

**Example Errors:**

-     est/fixtures/agent-schema/valid/menu-commands/all-command-types.agent.yaml: already exists
- src/modules/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/story-approved/instructions.md: No such file
- src/modules/bmm/workflows/workflow-status/paths/brownfield-level-3.yaml: patch does not apply

### Conclusion

**The PR is significantly outdated relative to the current 6-alpha branch:**

- Created: 2025-10-27
- Base SHA: b753fb293b9a18997bbfc731eb1a104e19fe6d28
- Current v6-alpha has diverged substantially since then
- PR would require a complete rebase to merge cleanly

### Revised Scope Assessment

The original analysis showing "15 files changed" was based on GitHub's API summary. The actual patch file reveals:

- **658 files are touched by this PR**
- This is FAR MORE comprehensive than initially thought
- The PR appears to be a massive find-replace operation across the entire codebase

### Critical Questions Raised

1. **Are all 658 changes legitimate v5→v6 fixes?**
   - Or are some changes unintended side effects?
2. **Does the 658-file PR cover ALL v5 references?**
   - Original grep found 100+ v5 refs in current v6-alpha
   - But v6-alpha has changed since PR was created
   - Need to analyze what the PR actually changes vs what still needs fixing
3. **Why can't the patch apply?**
   - PR is ~3 months old (created 2025-10-27, today is 2025-01-22)
   - v6-alpha has had significant development since then
   - Files added, removed, renamed, or modified

4. **What should the review strategy be?**
   - REQUEST CHANGES (ask contributor to rebase)?
   - CLOSE PR (too outdated, fix ourselves from current v6-alpha)?
   - EXTRACT INTENT (use PR as reference, apply our own comprehensive fix)?

---

## Next Phase Actions (Updated)

**Phase 1.3:** Analyze Patch Content Directly

- Extract sample changes from patch file to understand intent
- Identify patterns in the 658 files
- Categorize change types (documentation, code, config, etc.)

**Phase 1.4:** Compare Against Current State

- Cross-reference PR's 658 files against current v6-alpha grep results
- Determine if PR was comprehensive for its time
- Identify what's covered vs what's missing in current v6-alpha

**Phase 1.5:** Formulate Recommendation

- Option A: Request changes (rebase required)
- Option B: Close PR, create fresh comprehensive fix
- Option C: Hybrid approach (acknowledge PR, but fix independently)

---

**Updated Status:** Phase 1.2 COMPLETE - Patch failed to apply as expected (PR is outdated)  
**Next:** Phase 1.3 - Extract and analyze actual changes from 658-file patch
