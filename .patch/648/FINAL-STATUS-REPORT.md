## 🔧 Technical Details

### Change Context

**Issue**: Cursor IDE rules were not applying with the original configuration

**Root Cause**:

- Empty `description:` field was unnecessary
- Empty `globs: []` field wasn't filtering anything
- Rules needed to be "Apply Manually" (manual chat reference)

**Solution**:

```diff
- content += 'description: \n';
- content += 'globs: []\n';
```

**Result**: Rules now properly activate with `@<agent-name>` manual reference in Cursor chat

### Risk Assessment

**Risk Level**: MINIMAL

- No API changes
- No breaking changes
- Backward compatible
- Cursor-specific (isolated impact)
- No dependency changes
- No configuration changes needed
