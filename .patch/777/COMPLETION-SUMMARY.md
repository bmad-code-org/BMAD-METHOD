fix(github-copilot): add 'new' tool to chatmode configuration for file creation

- Add 'new' tool to tools array in GitHub Copilot chatmode config
- Enables BMAD agents to create new files via chat commands
- Positioned after 'editFiles' to maintain consistent pattern
- Complements existing file editing capability
- Fixes Issue #505: Analyst agent cannot create files

This change follows the pattern established in PR #324 and aligns with
Microsoft's GitHub Copilot extension documentation for file creation
capabilities. The 'new' tool is essential for agents to create
non-existent files when using custom chat modes.

Verified: npm validate passes, npm lint no new errors, installer
generates all chatmodes with 'new' tool, all 10 agents functional.

Fixes #505
```
