# PR #826 Recommendation

**Date:** 2025-01-28  
**Reviewer:** BMAD v6 Team  
**PR:** https://github.com/bmad-code-org/BMAD-METHOD/pull/826  
**Author:** @MikeLuu99

---

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: REQUEST CHANGES**

The contribution is valuable and well-written, but requires two mandatory fixes before merge:

1. **File relocation** from root to `docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md`
2. **Code style cleanup** to remove 148 trailing whitespace errors

Optional enhancement: Add BMAD workflow integration section (~1 hour effort)

---

## Decision Rationale

### Why Request Changes (Not Reject)?

**The content itself is excellent:**

- ✅ Comprehensive product planning checklist covering 8 key areas
- ✅ Well-structured with clear sections and actionable steps
- ✅ Professional quality writing
- ✅ Fills a gap in BMAD documentation (planning guidance)
- ✅ Significant contributor effort demonstrates community engagement

**The issues are fixable:**

- ✅ File placement: Simple relocation (30 seconds)
- ✅ Whitespace: Automated fix with Prettier (5 seconds)
- ✅ BMAD integration: Optional enhancement preserving original content

**Why not accept as-is?**

- ❌ Root placement violates 100% consistent BMAD convention (46/46 docs in `docs/`)
- ❌ Trailing whitespace fails CI checks (`npm run format:check`)
- ❌ Zero BMAD integration reduces value to BMAD users
- ❌ Accepting sets precedent for convention violations

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Content Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive coverage: Vision, audience, features, architecture, resources, market, risk, metrics
- Actionable structure: Each section has clear sub-tasks and considerations
- Professional format: Consistent use of headings, lists, and organization
- Practical value: Applicable to real-world product planning scenarios

**Weaknesses:**

- Generic content: No BMAD-specific references or workflow integration
- Overlaps with existing BMAD workflows (product-brief, research, prd, tech-spec, architecture)
- Placement: Root directory instead of `docs/` category structure
- Quality: 148 trailing whitespace errors throughout 147-line file

**Overall Assessment:** High-quality generic content that would benefit from BMAD integration

---

### 2. Convention Compliance

#### File Placement Analysis

**BMAD Documentation Structure (100% consistent):**

```
/                              # Root - Config only
├── README.md                 # Project overview
├── CHANGELOG.md              # Release history
├── CONTRIBUTING.md           # Contribution guide
├── LICENSE                   # Legal
├── package.json              # Dependencies
├── *.config.mjs              # Configuration
└── docs/                     # ALL documentation (46 files)
    ├── *.md                  # General guides (4 files)
    ├── ide-info/*.md         # IDE-specific (15 files)
    └── installers-bundlers/*.md  # Technical (3 files)
```

**PR #826 Violation:**

- Places `high-level-product-plan.md` at repository root
- Breaks 100% convention consistency (46/46 docs previously in `docs/`)
- Creates precedent for root-level documentation

**Required Fix:**

```
Move: /high-level-product-plan.md
To:   docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md
```

**Rationale:**

- `docs/` for documentation (established pattern)
- `planning/` as new category (similar to `ide-info/`, `installers-bundlers/`)
- `product-planning-checklist.md` as kebab-case descriptive name

#### Code Style Compliance

**Issue:** 148 trailing whitespace errors detected by Prettier

**Evidence:**

```bash
$ npx prettier --check "high-level-product-plan.md"
[warn] high-level-product-plan.md
[warn] Code style issues found in the above file.
```

**Impact:**

- Fails CI checks: `npm run format:check`
- Adds noise to git diffs
- Violates project code quality standards

**Required Fix:**

```bash
npx prettier --write docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md
```

**Effort:** 5 seconds (automated)

### 3. BMAD Integration Assessment

See `.patch/826/integration-assessment.md` for comprehensive section-by-section analysis.

**Summary:** The document covers 8 areas with significant overlap to existing BMAD workflows:

| Section                   | Current Content   | BMAD Workflow             | Integration Opportunity                |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1. Vision & Objectives    | Generic questions | `@product-brief`          | Add workflow reference + CLI example   |
| 2. Target Audience        | Generic personas  | `@research --user`        | Add user research workflow reference   |
| 3. Feature Planning       | Generic backlog   | `@prd`, `@tech-spec`      | Add PRD/spec workflow references       |
| 4. Technical Architecture | Generic questions | `@architecture`           | Add architecture workflow reference    |
| 5. Resources & Timeline   | Generic planning  | `@sprint-planning`        | Add sprint planning reference          |
| 6. Market Analysis        | Generic analysis  | `@research --market`      | Add market research workflow reference |
| 7. Risk Management        | Generic risks     | `@solutioning-gate-check` | Add validation workflow reference      |
| 8. Success Metrics        | Generic KPIs      | Workflow status           | Add `.bmad/status.yaml` reference      |

**Current Value:** Generic planning checklist for any product team  
**With Integration:** BMAD-aware guide showing practical workflow usage

**Recommended Approach:** Option B (Supplement) from integration-assessment.md

- Effort: ~1 hour
- Preserve original 8 sections entirely
- Add 9th section: "Using BMAD for Product Planning"
- Show workflow mappings with CLI examples
- Demonstrates BMAD coverage without rewriting contributor content

---

## Required Changes

### Change 1: File Relocation (MANDATORY)

**Current:**

```
/high-level-product-plan.md
```

**Required:**

```
docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md
```

**Steps:**

1. Create directory: `mkdir docs/planning`
2. Move file: `mv high-level-product-plan.md docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md`
3. (Or single PR update with new path)

**Why "product-planning-checklist.md"?**

- Descriptive: Clearly indicates content type
- Kebab-case: Matches 100% of BMAD docs convention
- Specific: Distinguishes from other planning guides
- SEO-friendly: Clear filename for documentation searches

### Change 2: Code Style Fix (MANDATORY)

**Command:**

```bash
npx prettier --write docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md
```

**Effect:**

- Removes 148 trailing whitespace errors
- Ensures consistent formatting
- Passes CI checks
- Automatic (no manual editing required)

**Verification:**

```bash
npx prettier --check docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md
# Should return: "All matched files use Prettier code style!"
```

## Optional Enhancements

### Enhancement 1: Add BMAD Integration Section (OPTIONAL)

**Proposed Addition:** New section 9 at end of document

````markdown
## 9. Using BMAD for Product Planning

This checklist can be executed using BMAD workflows. Here's how each section maps to BMAD commands:

### Phase 1: Discovery & Vision

- **Vision & Objectives** → `@product-brief` - Generate comprehensive product brief
- **Target Audience** → `@research --user` - User research and personas
- **Market Analysis** → `@research --market` - Market research and competitor analysis

### Phase 2: Planning & Specification

- **Feature Planning** → `@prd` - Product Requirements Document generation
- **Technical Architecture** → `@architecture` - Technical architecture planning
- **Resources & Timeline** → `@sprint-planning` - Sprint planning and estimation

### Phase 3: Validation & Risk Management

- **Risk Management** → `@solutioning-gate-check` - Architecture and risk validation
- **Success Metrics** → Workflow status tracking in `.bmad/status.yaml`

### Getting Started with BMAD Workflows

For details on any workflow:

```bash
bmad-cli workflow --info <workflow-name>
```
````

For the complete BMAD product development path:

```bash
bmad-cli workflow --path greenfield-level-1
```

See the [BMAD BMM Module](../../src/modules/bmm/README.md) for full workflow documentation.

```

**Benefits:**
- Makes generic content BMAD-specific
- Provides practical CLI usage examples
- Shows BMAD workflow coverage
- Preserves all original contributor content (sections 1-8 unchanged)
- Adds value for BMAD users without complete rewrite

**Effort:** ~1 hour (writing + testing links)

**Why Optional?**
- Contributor may prefer minimal changes
- Can be added in follow-up PR
- Not blocking for merge (nice-to-have)

## Review Comment Strategy

### Tone: Constructive and Appreciative

**Key Messages:**
1. **Thank contributor** for comprehensive and well-written content
2. **Explain BMAD conventions** (docs structure, code style) with examples
3. **Provide specific fixes** (relocation path, Prettier command) - make it easy
4. **Offer optional enhancement** (BMAD integration section) with example
5. **Encourage continued contribution** - this is valuable work

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Rejecting outright (content is good, just needs fixes)
- ❌ Demanding complete rewrite (original content is valuable)
- ❌ Criticizing approach (generic content has value)
- ❌ Being vague about fixes (provide exact commands)

**Embrace:**
- ✅ Specific, actionable feedback with examples
- ✅ Appreciation for effort and quality
- ✅ Clear explanation of BMAD conventions
- ✅ Optional enhancements (not requirements)
- ✅ Welcoming tone for future contributions

- Backward compatibility: New file, no existing references

---

## Conclusion

**Recommendation: REQUEST CHANGES with appreciation and specific guidance**

This PR contains valuable, well-written content that will benefit BMAD users. The required changes (relocation and code style) are minimal and straightforward. The optional BMAD integration would significantly increase value but is not mandatory.

**Next Steps:**
1. Post constructive review comment with:
   - Appreciation for contribution
   - Specific required fixes (relocation + Prettier)
   - Optional enhancement example (BMAD integration)
   - Offer of assistance
2. Monitor PR for response
3. Re-review and merge when fixes applied
4. Consider follow-up issue for BMAD integration if not included

**Estimated Resolution Time:**
- With contributor changes: 1-2 days (waiting for response)
- If we make changes: 15 minutes (relocation + Prettier + optional integration)
