## Key Findings

### Content Assessment

✅ **High-quality contribution:**

- Comprehensive 8-section product planning checklist
- Professional writing and organization
- Clear, actionable sub-tasks for each area
- Fills gap in BMAD documentation

### Issues Identified

1. **File Placement (REQUIRED FIX)**
   - Current: `/high-level-product-plan.md` (repository root)
   - Violation: Breaks 100% consistent convention (46/46 docs in `docs/`)
   - Required: `docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md`
   - Impact: Creates precedent for convention violations

2. **Code Style (REQUIRED FIX)**
   - Issue: 148 trailing whitespace errors
   - Test: `npx prettier --check` FAILED
   - Fix: `npx prettier --write docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md`
   - Impact: Fails CI checks

3. **BMAD Integration (OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENT)**
   - Current: Zero BMAD-specific references
   - Overlap: Significant with existing workflows (product-brief, research, prd, architecture, etc.)
   - Opportunity: Add section 9 showing BMAD workflow mappings
   - Effort: ~1 hour
   - Value: Transforms generic guide into BMAD-aware resource

## Lessons Learned

### Process Improvements

1. **Branch strategy works well:** pr-{number}-review branches keep workspace clean
2. **.patch/ directory effective:** Preserves all investigation artifacts for reference
3. **Phased approach valuable:** 7-phase plan kept investigation organized
4. **Todo tracking helpful:** Clear progress visibility throughout investigation

### Documentation Insights

1. **BMAD conventions are strict:** 100% consistency on docs/ placement helps new contributors
2. **Integration opportunities abound:** Generic content can often reference BMAD workflows
3. **Prettier is non-negotiable:** Trailing whitespace fails CI, must be addressed
4. **Constructive > prescriptive:** Offer examples, explain why, preserve contributor effort

### Review Insights

1. **Specificity matters:** "Relocate to docs/" is vague, "Move to docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md" is clear
2. **Commands >> descriptions:** Providing exact `mkdir` and `mv` commands reduces friction
3. **Optional enhancements >> requirements:** Let contributor choose BMAD integration depth
4. **Appreciation >> criticism:** Thank first, explain conventions, then suggest improvements
