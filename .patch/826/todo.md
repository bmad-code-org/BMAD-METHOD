## Quick Reference

**Files to check:**

- Repository root `*.md` files
- `docs/` directory structure
- `PRD.md`
- `README.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Existing workflow/template docs

**Key questions:**

1. Where should generic planning docs live?
2. Does this overlap with existing content?
3. Should this be BMAD-enhanced or kept generic?
4. Does the filename follow conventions?

**Likely outcome:**

- Accept with suggested relocation to `docs/planning/` or `docs/guides/`
- Optional: Suggest BMAD-specific enhancements
- Low risk, straightforward review
