## Current State: Zero BMAD Integration

The document is a generic software planning checklist with no references to:

- BMAD agents
- BMAD workflows
- BMAD CLI commands
- BMAD methodology (levels, phases)
- BMAD modules (BMB, BMM, CIS)

---

## Section-by-Section Integration Opportunities

### Section 1: Product Architecture & Type

**Current**: Generic application type list (SaaS, Web, Desktop, Mobile, etc.)

**BMAD Integration**:

```markdown
### Using BMAD for Architecture Planning

Define your product architecture using the BMAD `architect` agent:

\`\`\`bash
bmad architect
\*architecture
\`\`\`

The architect agent will guide you through:

- Application type selection
- Client architecture decisions
- Multi-platform considerations
- Tech stack alignment

See: [Architecture Workflow](../src/modules/bmm/workflows/3-architecture/README.md)
```

**Relevant Agents/Workflows**:

- `bmad architect` (BMM module)
- `*architecture` workflow
- Tech-spec workflow

---

### Section 2: Technology Stack

**Current**: Generic framework lists (React/Vue, Express/Django, etc.)

**BMAD Integration**:

```markdown
### Technology Stack with BMAD

Document your tech stack decisions using:

\`\`\`bash
bmad architect
\*tech-spec
\`\`\`

The tech-spec workflow captures:

- Primary and secondary languages
- Framework choices with rationale
- Development tools and dependencies
- Build and testing strategy

Output: `docs/tech-spec.md`

See: [Tech Spec Workflow](../src/modules/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/tech-spec/README.md)
```

**Relevant Agents/Workflows**:

- `bmad architect`
- `*tech-spec` workflow
- Tech context workflows

---

### Section 3: Infrastructure & Deployment

**Current**: Generic hosting/deployment options

**BMAD Integration**:

```markdown
### Infrastructure Planning with BMAD

Define infrastructure and deployment strategy as part of your architecture:

\`\`\`bash
bmad architect
\*architecture
\`\`\`

Include in your architecture document:

- Hosting strategy and cloud provider selection
- Deployment architecture (containers, CI/CD)
- Environment management approach
- Monitoring and observability plan

BMAD's architecture workflow ensures these decisions are:

- Documented in `docs/architecture.md`
- Accessible to all team agents
- Integrated with implementation workflows
```

**Relevant Agents/Workflows**:

- `bmad architect`
- Architecture workflow
- Infrastructure architecture section

---

### Section 4: Data & Security

**Current**: Generic data/security checklist

**BMAD Integration**:

```markdown
### Data & Security Planning

Capture data and security requirements in your technical specification:

\`\`\`bash
bmad architect  
\*tech-spec
\`\`\`

Use the architect agent to document:

- Database strategy and data modeling
- Security requirements (auth, encryption, compliance)
- Backup and disaster recovery plans
- Data privacy and regulatory compliance

For implementation, use:
\`\`\`bash
bmad dev
\*create-story
\`\`\`

To create security-focused development stories.
```

**Relevant Agents/Workflows**:

- `bmad architect` - Planning
- `bmad dev` - Implementation
- Story creation workflows

---

### Section 5: User Experience & Access

**Current**: Generic UX considerations

**BMAD Integration**:

```markdown
### UX Planning with BMAD CIS Module

\`\`\`bash
bmad brainstorm
\*design-thinking
\`\`\`

CIS workflows help with:

- User persona development
- Access pattern design
- Accessibility requirements
- Multi-user collaboration features

See: [CIS Module Documentation](../src/modules/cis/README.md)
```

**Relevant Agents/Workflows**:

- CIS module agents (brainstorming-coach, design-thinking-coach)
- Design thinking workflow
- User experience workflows

---

### Section 6: Scalability & Performance

**Current**: Generic performance requirements

**BMAD Integration**:

```markdown
### Performance & Scalability Planning

Document performance requirements in your architecture and tech-spec:

\`\`\`bash
bmad architect
\*architecture
\`\`\`

Include non-functional requirements:

- Response time and throughput targets
- Scalability strategy (horizontal/vertical)
- Resource management approach
- Caching and CDN strategy

Link these to acceptance criteria in development stories:
\`\`\`bash
bmad dev
\*create-story
\`\`\`
```

**Relevant Agents/Workflows**:

- `bmad architect` - Requirements
- `bmad dev` - Implementation stories
- Architecture workflow

---

### Section 7: Business & Operational Considerations

**Current**: Generic business operations

**BMAD Integration**:

```markdown
### Business Planning with BMAD

[BMAD Brownfield Guide](./bmad-brownfield-guide.md)
```

**Relevant Agents/Workflows**:

- `bmad pm` (Product Manager)
- `*prd` workflow
- `*brief` workflow for project initiation

---

### Section 8: Development Process

**Current**: Generic Agile/Scrum references

**BMAD Integration**:

```markdown
### Development Process: The BMAD Method

BMAD provides a scale-adaptive development methodology with 5 levels:

| Level | Scope         | Planning           | Workflows                                    |
| ----- | ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | Single story  | Minimal            | Direct to implementation                     |
| 1     | 2-4 stories   | Light brief        | Brief → implementation                       |
| 2     | 5-15 stories  | PRD + epics        | PRD → tech-spec → implementation             |
| 3     | 12-40 stories | PRD + architecture | Full planning → solutioning → implementation |
| 4     | 40+ stories   | Comprehensive      | Enterprise-scale workflows                   |

Start your project:
\`\`\`bash
bmad pm
\*workflow-status
\`\`\`

This initializes your project and guides you to the appropriate level and workflows.

See: [BMM Workflows](../src/modules/bmm/workflows/README.md)
```

**Relevant Agents/Workflows**:

- `bmad pm` - Project management
- `*workflow-status` - Project initialization
- Complete BMM workflow suite

## Suggested Document Structure with BMAD Integration

### Option A: BMAD-First Rewrite

Transform into: **"Product Planning with the BMAD Method"**

```markdown
# Product Planning with the BMAD Method

Use this guide with BMAD agents and workflows to plan your product comprehensively.

## Getting Started

Initialize your project:
\`\`\`bash
bmad pm
\*workflow-status
\`\`\`

## 1. Product Requirements (Levels 2-4)

Use `bmad pm` → `*prd` workflow...
[Content integrated with BMAD commands]

## 2. Architecture Planning (Levels 3-4)

Use `bmad architect` → `*architecture` workflow...
[Content integrated with BMAD commands]

...etc
```

### Option B: Reference with BMAD Supplement

Keep generic reference, add BMAD section:

```markdown
# High Level Product Planning Considerations

[Generic content as-is]

---

## Using BMAD for Product Planning

This checklist can be completed systematically using BMAD workflows:

### Planning Phase

- **Product Requirements**: `bmad pm` → `*prd`
- **Architecture**: `bmad architect` → `*architecture`
- **Technical Spec**: `bmad architect` → `*tech-spec`

### Implementation Phase

- **Story Creation**: `bmad dev` → `*create-story`
- **Development**: `bmad dev` → `*dev-story`

For detailed workflow documentation, see:

- [BMM Module](../src/modules/bmm/README.md)
- [BMAD Workflows](../src/modules/bmm/workflows/README.md)
```

---

## Integration Effort Estimate

**Option A (BMAD-First Rewrite)**: 3-4 hours

- Rewrite each section with BMAD integration
- Add CLI examples throughout
- Link to specific workflows
- Test all commands and links

**Option B (Reference + Supplement)**: 1 hour

- Add BMAD section at end
- Create workflow mapping table
- Add key links
- Minimal content changes

---

## Recommendation

**Suggested approach**: Option B (Reference + Supplement)

**Rationale**:

1. Preserves contributor's work
2. Low effort, high value
3. Maintains generic reference utility
4. Adds BMAD-specific guidance
5. Respects different user needs (some may want generic checklist)

**Implementation**:

1. Relocate to `docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md`
2. Add BMAD integration section at end
3. Include workflow mapping table
4. Link to BMM module documentation
5. Update PR with suggested changes

---

## Alternative: Link Instead of Integrate

If the contributor prefers to keep it fully generic:

**Path**: `docs/references/product-planning-considerations.md`

**Addition**: Simple disclaimer

```markdown
> **Note**: This is a general-purpose planning reference.
> For BMAD-specific planning workflows, see the [BMM Module](../src/modules/bmm/README.md).
```

This respects the generic nature while providing clear navigation to BMAD-specific resources.
