## Review Comment

Hi @MikeLuu99! üëã

Thank you for this comprehensive and well-written product planning checklist! The content is excellent and will be a valuable addition to the BMAD documentation. I really appreciate the effort you've put into creating such a thorough guide covering all the key areas of product planning.

After reviewing the PR, I have **two required changes** before we can merge, plus one optional enhancement that would increase value for BMAD users. Both required changes are straightforward and quick to implement.

---

### ‚úÖ What's Great

- **Comprehensive coverage**: Your checklist covers all essential product planning areas (vision, audience, features, architecture, resources, market, risk, metrics)
- **Well-structured**: Clear sections with actionable sub-tasks
- **Professional quality**: Consistent formatting and organization
- **Fills a gap**: BMAD doesn't currently have a high-level planning checklist like this

---

### üîß Required Changes

#### 1. File Relocation (REQUIRED)

The file is currently placed at the repository root (`/high-level-product-plan.md`), but BMAD documentation follows a consistent structure where **all documentation lives in the `docs/` directory** with category subdirectories.

**Current placement:**

```
/high-level-product-plan.md  ‚ùå
```

**Required placement:**

```
docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md  ‚úÖ
```

**Why this location?**

- `docs/` - All 46 existing BMAD documentation files live here (100% consistent)
- `planning/` - New category for planning guides (similar to `docs/ide-info/`, `docs/installers-bundlers/`)
- `product-planning-checklist.md` - Kebab-case filename matching BMAD conventions

**How to fix:**

```bash
# Create the new category directory
mkdir docs/planning

# Move and rename the file
mv high-level-product-plan.md docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md
```

Or simply update the file path in your PR to `docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md`.

---

#### 2. Code Style Cleanup (REQUIRED)

The file has trailing whitespace on 148 lines, which causes our CI checks to fail. This is easy to fix automatically with Prettier:

**Command:**

```bash
npx prettier --write docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md
```

**What this does:**

- Removes trailing whitespace
- Ensures consistent formatting
- Makes the file pass `npm run format:check`

**Verification:**

```bash
npx prettier --check docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md
# Should output: "All matched files use Prettier code style!"
```

### üí° Optional Enhancement: BMAD Integration

Your checklist is currently a generic product planning guide, which is valuable! However, BMAD has workflows that directly support many of the planning activities you've outlined. Adding a section showing how to use BMAD workflows for each planning phase would make this document even more valuable for BMAD users.

**Here's an example section you could add at the end:**

````markdown
## 9. Using BMAD for Product Planning

This checklist can be executed using BMAD workflows. Here's how each section maps to BMAD commands:

### Phase 1: Discovery & Vision

- **Vision & Objectives** ‚Üí `@product-brief` - Generate comprehensive product brief
- **Target Audience** ‚Üí `@research --user` - User research and personas
- **Market Analysis** ‚Üí `@research --market` - Market research and competitor analysis

### Phase 2: Planning & Specification

- **Feature Planning** ‚Üí `@prd` - Product Requirements Document generation
- **Technical Architecture** ‚Üí `@architecture` - Technical architecture planning
- **Resources & Timeline** ‚Üí `@sprint-planning` - Sprint planning and estimation

### Phase 3: Validation & Risk Management

- **Risk Management** ‚Üí `@solutioning-gate-check` - Architecture and risk validation
- **Success Metrics** ‚Üí Workflow status tracking in `.bmad/status.yaml`

### Getting Started with BMAD Workflows

For details on any workflow:

```bash
bmad-cli workflow --info <workflow-name>
```
````

For the complete BMAD product development path:

```bash
bmad-cli workflow --path greenfield-level-1
```

See the [BMAD BMM Module](../../src/modules/bmm/README.md) for full workflow documentation.

```

**Why this helps:**
- Shows practical BMAD workflow usage
- Demonstrates how BMAD supports the entire planning process
- Provides CLI examples for users to get started
- Preserves your original content (sections 1-8 unchanged)

**This is optional** - the required changes are just the relocation and code style fix. If you'd prefer to keep the guide generic, that's totally fine! We can always add BMAD integration in a follow-up PR.

### üìã Summary of Changes Needed

**Required (must have for merge):**
1. ‚úÖ Relocate file to `docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md`
2. ‚úÖ Run `npx prettier --write docs/planning/product-planning-checklist.md`

**Optional (nice to have):**
3. üí° Add BMAD workflow integration section (see example above)

### ü§ù Need Help?

If you have any questions about these changes or would like me to help make them, just let me know! I'm happy to:
- Provide more examples of BMAD workflow integration
- Answer questions about BMAD documentation conventions
- Assist with the changes if you're short on time

Thanks again for this contribution - looking forward to seeing this merged! üöÄ
