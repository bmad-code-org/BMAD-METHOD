# Detection Report: Issue #478 Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Issue**: No BMad installation found in current directory tree
**Status**: Analysis Complete

---

## FINDINGS

### 1. ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

The issue is NOT about a `findInstallation()` function as initially suspected, but rather about how the status command resolves the working directory.

**Problem Flow**:

```
1. User runs: npx bmad-method status
2. npx may change the working directory to node_modules/.bin
3. Status command uses default directory "." (current working directory)
4. path.resolve(".") resolves relative to the changed working directory
5. Result: Looks in wrong location, doesn't find .bmad-core/
```

### 2. KEY CODE LOCATIONS

**File 1**: `tools/cli/commands/status.js` (Lines 8-9)

```javascript
options: [['-d, --directory <path>', 'Installation directory', '.']],
action: async (options) => {
  const status = await installer.getStatus(options.directory);
```

**Issue**: Default directory is "." but context may be wrong when invoked via npx

**File 2**: `tools/cli/installers/lib/core/installer.js` (Lines 626-629)

```javascript
async getStatus(directory) {
  const bmadDir = path.join(path.resolve(directory), 'bmad');
  return await this.detector.detect(bmadDir);
}
```

**Problem**: `path.resolve(directory)` uses `process.cwd()` as base, which may be wrong

**File 3**: `tools/cli/installers/lib/core/detector.js` (Lines 1-150)

```javascript
class Detector {
  async detect(bmadDir) {
    // Checks only the provided bmadDir
    // Does NOT search up the directory tree
    // Does NOT search for .bmad-core/ or .bmad-* folders
  }
}
```

**Issue**: Detector expects the exact path to the bmad folder, doesn't search

### 3. THE REAL PROBLEM

The current implementation:

1. ✅ Works: `bmad-method status` (from within project, current dir is project root)
2. ❌ Fails: `npx bmad-method status` (npx changes working directory)
3. ❌ Fails: `bmad-method status` from subdirectory (doesn't search parent dirs)

The implementation requires users to either:

- Run from project root with correct directory
- Explicitly pass `-d /path/to/project`

But it should:

- Auto-detect BMAD installation in current directory tree
- Search up the directory hierarchy for `.bmad-*` folders
- Work regardless of where npx changes the working directory

### 4. WHAT NEEDS TO CHANGE

**Current Behavior**:

```
Status checks specific path: /project/bmad
If not there → "No BMAD installation found"
```

**Desired Behavior**:

```
Status searches from current directory:
1. Check ./bmad/
2. Check ../ bmad/
3. Check ../../bmad/
Until found or reach filesystem root
Also support legacy: .bmad-core/, .bmad-*, .bmm/, .cis/
```

### 5. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY

**Option A**: Add search function (Recommended)

- Create `findInstallation(startDir)` that searches up the tree
- Update `getStatus()` to use search function
- Returns path to closest BMAD installation

**Option B**: Fix working directory context

- Capture original working directory at CLI entry point
- Pass throughout the call chain
- Use for resolving relative paths

**Recommendation**: Combine both approaches

1. Fix the working directory context (handle npx correctly)
2. Add directory search for better UX (works from subdirectories)

### 6. AFFECTED FUNCTIONS

**Direct Impact**:

- `Installer.getStatus(directory)` - needs to search, not just check one path
- `Detector.detect(bmadDir)` - works as-is, but only checks provided path

**Indirect Impact**:

- `StatusCommand.action()` - may need to handle working directory
- CLI entry point - may need to capture originalCwd

### 7. TEST SCENARIOS NEEDED

**Scenario 1**: Run status from project root

```bash
cd /home/user/my-project
npx bmad-method status
```

**Current**: ❌ Fails (npx changes cwd)
**Expected**: ✅ Detects .bmad-core/ or bmad/ folder

**Scenario 2**: Run status from project subdirectory

```bash
cd /home/user/my-project/src
npx bmad-method status
```

**Current**: ❌ Fails (no installation in src/)
**Expected**: ✅ Searches up and finds ../bmad/

**Scenario 3**: Run status with explicit path

```bash
npx bmad-method status -d /home/user/my-project
```

**Current**: ✅ Works
**Expected**: ✅ Still works

### 8. MIGRATION PATH

1. **Phase 1**: Add `findInstallation(searchPath)` function
   - Searches directory tree upward
   - Returns path to nearest BMAD installation
   - Handles legacy folder names

2. **Phase 2**: Update `getStatus()` to use search
   - If explicit path given, check that path
   - Otherwise, search from current directory
   - Return installation details or null

3. **Phase 3**: Handle npx working directory
   - Optional: Capture originalCwd at CLI level
   - Improves reliability when running via npx

4. **Phase 4**: Comprehensive testing
   - Unit tests for search function
   - Integration tests for status command
   - Edge case tests (nested, legacy, symlinks, etc.)

## CODE MODIFICATIONS NEEDED

### New Function: findInstallation()

```javascript
async findInstallation(searchPath = process.cwd()) {
  let currentPath = path.resolve(searchPath);
  const root = path.parse(currentPath).root;

  while (currentPath !== root) {
    // Check for modern BMAD installation
    const bmadPath = path.join(currentPath, 'bmad');
    if (await fs.pathExists(bmadPath)) {
      return bmadPath;
    }

    // Check for legacy installations
    const legacyFolders = ['.bmad-core', '.bmad-method', '.bmm', '.cis'];
    for (const folder of legacyFolders) {
      const legacyPath = path.join(currentPath, folder);
      if (await fs.pathExists(legacyPath)) {
        return legacyPath;
      }
    }

    // Move up one directory
    currentPath = path.dirname(currentPath);
  }

  return null; // Not found
}
```

### Modified getStatus()

```javascript
async getStatus(directory) {
  let searchPath = directory === '.' ? process.cwd() : path.resolve(directory);
  const installPath = await this.findInstallation(searchPath);

  if (!installPath) {
    return { installed: false, message: 'No BMAD installation found' };
  }

  return await this.detector.detect(installPath);
}
```

## FILES TO MODIFY

1. `tools/cli/installers/lib/core/installer.js`
   - Add `findInstallation()` method
   - Update `getStatus()` to use it
   - Lines: ~626, ~new

2. `tools/cli/commands/status.js`
   - May need to handle originalCwd
   - Lines: ~8-9 (optional)

## SUCCESS METRICS

✅ After fix:

1. `npx bmad-method status` works from project root
2. `npx bmad-method status` works from project subdirectories
3. `bmad-method status` works without explicit path
4. All existing tests pass
5. New tests verify the fix

## ESTIMATED EFFORT

- Implementation: 1-2 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- Review & fixes: 1 hour
- **Total**: 4-6 hours

## NEXT STEPS

1. ✅ Detection complete - move to Phase 2
2. Create unit tests for `findInstallation()`
3. Create integration tests for status command
4. Implement the fix
5. Validate all tests pass
