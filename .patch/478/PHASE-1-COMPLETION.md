# PHASE 1 COMPLETION REPORT: Issue #478 Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Findings**: Detection complete, root cause identified

---

## PHASE 1: ISSUE DETECTION & ANALYSIS - RESULTS

### ✅ Task 1.1: Locate Key Source Files (COMPLETED)

**Found**:

- ✅ `tools/cli/installers/lib/core/installer.js` - Contains `getStatus()` method
- ✅ `tools/cli/installers/lib/core/detector.js` - Contains `Detector` class
- ✅ `tools/cli/commands/status.js` - Status command entry point

**Key Finding**: There is NO separate `findInstallation()` function as initially suspected. The issue is within `getStatus()` method which doesn't search the directory tree.

### ✅ Task 1.2: Understand Current Implementation (COMPLETED)

**Current Flow**:

1. User runs: `npx bmad-method status`
2. Status command calls: `installer.getStatus(options.directory)` where `directory = "."`
3. getStatus() calls: `path.join(path.resolve(directory), 'bmad')`
4. Detector checks only that exact path: `/resolved/path/bmad`
5. If not there → Returns "installed: false"

**Problem**:

- `path.resolve(".")` uses current working directory at that moment
- When run via npx, current working directory may be node_modules
- Doesn't search parent directories
- Doesn't look for legacy folder names (.bmad-core, .bmad-method, etc.)

**Current Code Issues**:

```javascript
// installer.js line 626-629
async getStatus(directory) {
  const bmadDir = path.join(path.resolve(directory), 'bmad');  // ← Problem here
  return await this.detector.detect(bmadDir);  // ← Only checks this one path
}

// detector.js lines 1-150
async detect(bmadDir) {
  // Only checks if bmadDir exists
  // Does NOT search directory tree
}
```

### ✅ Task 1.3: Create Detection Report (COMPLETED)

**Deliverable**: `DETECTION-REPORT.md` created with:

- Root cause analysis ✓
- Code location mapping ✓
- Problem flow diagram ✓
- Implementation strategy ✓
- Test scenarios ✓
- Migration path ✓

## KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY

### What's NOT the issue:

- ❌ NO separate `findInstallation()` function exists
- ❌ NOT about passing originalCwd through a chain
- ❌ NOT specifically about npx (though it's affected)

### What IS the issue:

- ✅ Status command only checks `/project/bmad/`
- ✅ Doesn't search up directory tree
- ✅ Doesn't look for legacy folder names
- ✅ Works only if:
  - Running from project root AND
  - BMAD installed in `projectRoot/bmad/` OR
  - Explicit path provided with `-d`

### Required Fix:

```
Add: findInstallation(searchPath) that searches up tree
Update: getStatus() to use findInstallation()
Result: Works from any subdirectory, any nesting level
```

## IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST FOR NEXT PHASES

### Phase 2: Create Detection Tests

- [ ] `test/unit/find-installation.test.js` - NEW
  - [ ] Test search from project root
  - [ ] Test search from subdirectory
  - [ ] Test search with no installation
  - [ ] Test search with legacy folders
  - [ ] Test search reaching filesystem root

- [ ] `test/integration/status-command-detection.test.js` - NEW
  - [ ] Test `npx bmad-method status` from root
  - [ ] Test from subdirectory
  - [ ] Test with -d flag

- [ ] Create `test/fixtures/bmad-project-478/` with structures

### Phase 3: Implement Fix

- [ ] Add `findInstallation(searchPath)` to Installer class
- [ ] Update `getStatus(directory)` to use new function
- [ ] Handle both modern and legacy folder names
- [ ] Add proper error handling

### Phase 4: Validation Tests

- [ ] Update tests to verify fix works
- [ ] Add regression tests for existing commands
- [ ] Edge case tests (symlinks, nested, etc.)

### Phase 5: Execute & Validate

- [ ] Run: `npm test`
- [ ] Run: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Run: `npm run format:check`
- [ ] Manual test with real project
- [ ] Document in PR

**Based on**:

- ✅ Direct code review of all files
- ✅ Reproduction of bug scenario
- ✅ Understanding of npx behavior
- ✅ Alignment with issue comments
- ✅ Alignment with PR #480 context

**Minor Uncertainty** (5%):

- May not have seen all potential entry points
- Possible undiscovered complexity in installer
