## 🎯 What the Fix Does

**Problem**: Agents were setting invalid status values that don't match story template

**Invalid Status Values**:

- `'Ready for Review'` - not in template enum
- `'Ready for Done'` - not in template enum

**Valid Status Values** (from story template):

- `Draft`
- `Approved`
- `InProgress`
- `Review`
- `Done`

**Changes Made**:

**File 1**: bmad-core/agents/dev.md (line 68)

```diff
- set story status: 'Ready for Review'→HALT"
+ set story status: 'Review'→HALT"
```

**File 2**: bmad-core/tasks/apply-qa-fixes.md (lines 107-108)

```diff
- If gate was PASS and all identified gaps are closed → set `Status: Ready for Done`
- Otherwise → set `Status: Ready for Review` and notify QA to re-run the review
+ If gate was PASS and all identified gaps are closed → set `Status: Done`
+ Otherwise → set `Status: Review` and notify QA to re-run the review
```
