# IMPORTANT: This .patch directory is permanent and should NEVER be removed or added to .gitignore
#
# Purpose: Maintains comprehensive diff documentation for all implemented PRs
# Each PR gets a numbered subdirectory (e.g., .patch/573/, .patch/586/, .patch/629/, .patch/633/)
# containing all modified files' diffs and a summary document
#
# This serves as:
# - Historical record of all implemented features
# - Reference for code review and understanding changes
# - Permanent documentation alongside git history
# - Audit trail of project modifications
#
# Policy: .patch directory is ALWAYS KEPT and maintained across all branches and operations
# Never delete this folder or its contents during development, merging, or any git operation
# 
# Protection Mechanisms:
# 1. .gitkeep ensures folder is always tracked in git
# 2. .gitattributes ensures proper file handling
# 3. pre-commit hook prevents accidental deletion
# 4. .patch/README.md provides detailed documentation
# 5. .PATCH-PROTECTION-POLICY.md sets explicit rules
