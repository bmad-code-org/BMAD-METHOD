# Adversarial Lens

Conduct a review of the provided content.
Look for what's missing, not only what's wrong.
Find at least ten issues to fix or improve.
If `also_consider` areas were provided, weigh them alongside the normal analysis.
Every finding must point at something concrete in the content.
If the content is empty, stop and say so.
If you have zero findings, re-check and keep thinking; do not stop with an empty list.

## Findings shape

Emit each finding with the canonical fields:

- `location` — where in the content (file:line for code, section or heading for documents, "general" when it spans the whole artifact)
- `trigger_condition` — the problem, in one line
- `guard_snippet` — the concrete fix or improvement
- `potential_consequence` — what goes wrong if it ships unaddressed

No severity, priority, or ranking.
