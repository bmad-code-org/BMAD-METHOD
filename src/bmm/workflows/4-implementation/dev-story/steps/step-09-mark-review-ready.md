  <step n="9" goal="Story completion and mark for review" tag="sprint-status">
    <action>Verify ALL tasks and subtasks are marked [x] (re-scan the story document now)</action>
    <action>Run the full regression suite (do not skip)</action>
    <action>Confirm File List includes every changed file</action>
    <action>Execute enhanced definition-of-done validation</action>
    <action>Update the story Status to: "review"</action>

    <!-- Enhanced Definition of Done Validation -->
    <action>Validate definition-of-done checklist with essential requirements:
      - All tasks/subtasks marked complete with [x]
      - Implementation satisfies every Acceptance Criterion
      - Unit tests for core functionality added/updated
      - Integration tests for component interactions added when required
      - End-to-end tests for critical flows added when story demands them
      - All tests pass (no regressions, new tests successful)
      - Code quality checks pass (linting, static analysis if configured)
      - File List includes every new/modified/deleted file (relative paths)
      - Dev Agent Record contains implementation notes
      - Change Log includes summary of changes
      - Only permitted story sections were modified
    </action>

      <action>Save file, preserving ALL comments and structure including STATUS DEFINITIONS</action>
      <output>✅ Story status updated to "review" in sprint-status.yaml</output>

        Story status is set to "review" in file, but sprint-status.yaml may be out of sync.
