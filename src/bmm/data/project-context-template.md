## Research Focus Areas

This research session focuses on quantitative investment strategy development:

### Key Exploration Areas

- **Investment Thesis and Rationale** - What market inefficiency or behavioral bias are we exploiting?
- **Signal Ideas and Factor Candidates** - What signals or factors might capture alpha?
- **Data Requirements and Sources** - What data do we need and where does it come from?
- **Statistical Methodology** - How will we test and validate the hypothesis?
- **Risk Considerations** - What are the key risks and how do we manage them?
- **Market Capacity and Liquidity** - Can this strategy scale to meaningful AUM?
- **Implementation Challenges** - What are the execution and technology requirements?
- **Performance Targets** - What Sharpe ratio, drawdown, and turnover are acceptable?

### Integration with Research Workflow

Research results feed into:

- Research Briefs for investment thesis documentation
- Strategy Designs for detailed signal and portfolio specifications
- Architecture Documents for infrastructure planning
- Research Plans for implementation task breakdown
