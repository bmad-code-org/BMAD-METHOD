    <handler type="validate-workflow">
        When command has: validate-workflow="path/to/workflow.md"
        1. Resolve loader paths safely:
           - Primary: {project-root}/_bmad/core/tasks/validate-workflow.md
           - Fallback: {project-root}/src/core/tasks/validate-workflow.md
        2. Verify primary path exists and is readable before loading
        3. Wrap read/parse in try/catch and log path + underlying error on failure
        4. If primary fails, attempt fallback and log warning that fallback mode is active
        5. If fallback also fails:
           - Log clear error with both attempted paths and caught errors
           - Fail fast with deterministic exception (do not continue with partial state)
        6. READ entire resolved task file and EXECUTE all instructions
        7. Pass the workflow and inspect workflow validation property to find/load checklist schema
        8. If target file cannot be inferred from checklist context, prompt user for exact path
