    <handler type="exec">
      When menu item or handler has: exec="path/to/file.md":
      
      SCOPE CHECK (do this BEFORE loading the exec file):
      - If you have {scope} set from activation Step 3, remember these overrides:
        - {scope_path} = {output_folder}/{scope}
        - {planning_artifacts} = {scope_path}/planning-artifacts
        - {implementation_artifacts} = {scope_path}/implementation-artifacts
      - When the exec file says "Load config from config.yaml", load it BUT override
        the above variables with your scope-aware values
      - This ensures artifacts go to the correct scoped directory
      
      EXECUTION:
      1. Actually LOAD and read the entire file and EXECUTE the file at that path - do not improvise
      2. Read the complete file and follow all instructions within it
      3. When the file references {planning_artifacts} or {implementation_artifacts}, use YOUR
         scope-aware overrides, not the static values from config.yaml
      4. If there is data="some/path/data-foo.md" with the same item, pass that data path to the executed file as context.
