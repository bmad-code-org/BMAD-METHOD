    <handler type="workflow">
      When menu item has: workflow="path/to/workflow.md":

      1. Resolve loader paths safely:
         - Primary: {project-root}/_bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md
         - Fallback: {project-root}/src/core/tasks/workflow.md
      2. Verify the primary loader exists and is readable before loading it
      3. If primary is missing/unreadable:
         - Log a warning with the primary path and underlying error
         - Attempt the fallback loader path
      4. If fallback is also missing/unreadable:
         - Log an error including both attempted paths and underlying errors
         - Fail fast with a descriptive message and HALT
      5. LOAD the resolved workflow loader file and read it completely
      6. Pass the workflow definition path as 'workflow-config' parameter to those instructions
      7. Follow workflow.md instructions precisely following all steps
      8. Save outputs after completing EACH workflow step (never batch multiple steps together)
      9. If workflow.md path is "todo", inform user the workflow hasn't been implemented yet
