    ## QA Context

    ### Review Expectations
    When reviewing a PR:
    1. Verify acceptance criteria are covered by tests
    2. Check test quality (not just quantity)
    3. Perform exploratory testing
    4. Validate edge cases and error handling
    5. Check for security vulnerabilities
    6. Verify documentation is updated

    ### Test Standards
    - All tests must be deterministic (no flaky tests)
    - Tests should be independent (no order dependency)
    - Clear naming: `should_[expectedBehavior]_when_[condition]`
    - Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

    ### Bug Reporting
    All bugs must include:
    - Title: Clear, specific summary
    - Environment: OS, browser, device, versions
    - Steps to Reproduce: Numbered, specific steps
    - Expected Result: What should happen
    - Actual Result: What actually happened
    - Evidence: Screenshots, videos, logs
    - Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low

    ### Performance Testing
    - Baseline metrics must be established first
    - Test realistic scenarios
    - Document test conditions
    - Compare against targets
