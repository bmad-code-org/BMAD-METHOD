    ## Technical Context

    ### Project Standards
    - Kotlin with Jetpack Compose
    - Follow architecture in `app/src/main/java`
    - Use project's base classes and utilities
    - All strings externalized for localization

    ### Code Style
    - ktlint configured
    - Run `./gradlew ktlintFormat` before committing
    - Follow Kotlin coding conventions

    ### Architecture
    - MVVM with ViewModels
    - Repository pattern for data
    - Use cases for business logic
    - Hilt for dependency injection

    ### Offline-First Requirements
    - All data operations must work offline
    - Use Room for local storage
    - WorkManager for background sync
    - Handle conflict resolution per spec

    ### Performance Targets
    - Cold start: <2 seconds on Pixel 4a
    - Memory: <150MB typical usage
    - Battery: No wakelocks, efficient sync
    - APK size: <30MB

    ### Testing Requirements
    - Unit tests for ViewModels and UseCases
    - Room tests for database operations
    - Espresso tests for critical user flows
    - Mock API responses for consistency

  submission_checklist: |
    Before submitting, verify:
    - [ ] All acceptance criteria met
    - [ ] Works offline (airplane mode test)
    - [ ] Sync works correctly when online
    - [ ] Tests passing: `./gradlew test`
    - [ ] Lint passing: `./gradlew lint`
    - [ ] ktlint: `./gradlew ktlintCheck`
    - [ ] No memory leaks (test with LeakCanary)
    - [ ] Tested on low-end device or emulator (2GB RAM)
    - [ ] APK attached (debug build)
    - [ ] PR includes testing instructions

  review_criteria: |
    Code will be reviewed for:
    1. **Functionality** - Meets acceptance criteria
    2. **Offline Support** - Works without network
    3. **Performance** - No ANRs, acceptable memory usage
    4. **Architecture** - Follows project patterns
    5. **Tests** - Adequate coverage
    6. **Kotlin** - Idiomatic, no Java patterns
    7. **UX** - Follows Material Design, handles edge cases
