    ## Technical Context

    ### Project Standards
    - React 18+ with TypeScript
    - Follow component patterns in `src/components`
    - Use project's design system tokens
    - All text must be internationalization-ready

    ### Code Style
    - ESLint + Prettier configured
    - Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before committing
    - TypeScript strict mode enabled

    ### Component Guidelines
    - Functional components with hooks only
    - Props interface defined for all components
    - Default exports for page components
    - Named exports for shared components

    ### Testing Requirements
    - Unit tests with React Testing Library
    - Test user interactions, not implementation
    - Mock API calls with MSW
    - Accessibility tests with jest-axe

    ### Styling
    - Tailwind CSS utility classes
    - No inline styles except dynamic values
    - Follow design system spacing/colors
    - Mobile-first responsive design
