# Step 6: Meal Prep Execution Schedule

## 🎯 Objective

Create a realistic meal prep schedule that fits the user's lifestyle and ensures success.

## 📋 MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

- 🛑 NEVER suggest a prep schedule that requires more time than user has available
- 📖 CRITICAL: Base schedule on user's actual cooking frequency
- 🔄 CRITICAL: Include storage and reheating instructions
- ✅ Start with a sustainable prep routine
- 🚫 DO NOT overwhelm with too much at once

### 1. Time Commitment Analysis

Based on user profile:

- **Available prep time per week**
- **Preferred prep days** (weekend vs weeknight)
- **Energy levels throughout day**
- **Kitchen limitations**

### 2. Prep Strategy Options

#### Option A: Sunday Batch Prep (2-3 hours)

- Prep all proteins for week
- Chop all vegetables
- Cook grains in bulk
- Portion snacks

#### Option B: Semi-Weekly Prep (1-1.5 hours x 2)

- Sunday: Proteins + grains
- Wednesday: Refresh veggies + prep second half

#### Option C: Daily Prep (15-20 minutes daily)

- Prep next day's lunch
- Quick breakfast assembly
- Dinner prep each evening

### 3. Detailed Timeline Breakdown

```
Sunday (2 hours):
2:00-2:30: Preheat oven, marinate proteins
2:30-3:15: Cook proteins (bake chicken, cook ground turkey)
3:15-3:45: Cook grains (rice, quinoa)
3:45-4:00: Chop vegetables and portion snacks
4:00-4:15: Clean and organize refrigerator
```

## 📦 Storage Guidelines:

### Protein Storage:

- Cooked chicken: 4 days refrigerated, 3 months frozen
- Ground meat: 3 days refrigerated, 3 months frozen
- Fish: Best fresh, 2 days refrigerated

### Vegetable Storage:

- Cut vegetables: 3-4 days in airtight containers
- Hard vegetables: Up to 1 week (carrots, bell peppers)
- Leafy greens: 2-3 days with paper towels

### Meal Assembly:

- Keep sauces separate until eating
- Consider texture changes when reheating
- Label with preparation date

## 🔧 ADAPTATION STRATEGIES:

### For Busy Weeks:

- Emergency freezer meals
- Quick backup options
- 15-minute meal alternatives

### For Low Energy Days:

- No-cook meal options
- Smoothie packs
- Assembly-only meals

### For Social Events:

- Flexible meal timing
- Restaurant integration
- "Off-plan" guilt-free guidelines

## ✅ SUCCESS METRICS:

- Realistic time commitment
- Clear instructions for each prep session
- Storage and reheating guidelines included
- Backup plans for busy weeks
- Sustainable long-term approach

## ❌ FAILURE MODES TO AVOID:

- Overly ambitious prep schedule
- Not accounting for cleaning time
- Ignoring user's energy patterns
- No flexibility for unexpected events
- Complex instructions for beginners

## 💬 SAMPLE DIALOG STYLE:

**✅ GOOD (Intent-based):**
"Based on your 2-hour Sunday availability, we could create a prep schedule that sets you up for the week. We'll batch cook proteins and grains, then do quick assembly each evening. How does that sound with your energy levels?"

**❌ AVOID (Prescriptive):**
"You must prep every Sunday from 2-4 PM. No exceptions."
