# Brand Voice & Tone Guide

## Objective
Create clear guidelines for brand voice and tone to ensure consistent communication.

## Voice vs. Tone

**Voice** = Your brand's personality (constant)
**Tone** = Emotional inflection based on context (variable)

## Voice Definition

Define 3-5 voice characteristics:

Example: "Professional, Approachable, Expert"
- **Professional**: We're knowledgeable and trustworthy
- **Approachable**: We're friendly and easy to work with
- **Expert**: We provide authoritative guidance

For each characteristic:
- Definition and description
- How it sounds in practice
- What it is and what it isn't
- Example phrases

## Tone Variations

Define tone for different contexts:
- Marketing campaigns (inspirational, enthusiastic)
- Product descriptions (informative, benefit-focused)
- Customer support (empathetic, solution-oriented)
- Error messages (apologetic, helpful)
- Social media (casual, engaging)
- Thought leadership (authoritative, insightful)

## Do's and Don'ts

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use active voice | Use passive voice |
| Be specific | Be vague |
| Show personality | Sound corporate |

## Deliverables

1. **Voice Definition** - Core characteristics
2. **Tone Matrix** - Variations by context
3. **Examples** - Good and bad samples
4. **Guidelines** - Practical writing rules
