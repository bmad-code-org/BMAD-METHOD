# Multi-Channel Marketing Strategy

## Objective
Develop optimal marketing channel mix with strategic budget allocation and platform-specific tactics.

## Channel Evaluation Process

### 1. Assess Available Channels

For each potential channel, evaluate:

**Channel Fit**
- Audience alignment: Is our target audience active here?
- Objective alignment: Does it support our goals (awareness, consideration, conversion)?
- Budget fit: Can we achieve meaningful scale within budget?

**Channel Characteristics**

**Google Search**
- Strengths: High intent, conversion-focused, precise targeting
- Best for: Bottom-funnel, product search, high-consideration purchases
- Typical ROAS: 3-8x
- Minimum viable budget: $2-5K/month

**Facebook/Instagram**
- Strengths: Massive reach, detailed targeting, visual storytelling
- Best for: Awareness, consideration, retargeting, ecommerce
- Typical ROAS: 2-5x
- Minimum viable budget: $3-10K/month

**LinkedIn**
- Strengths: B2B targeting, professional context, decision-maker access
- Best for: B2B, high-value products, thought leadership
- Typical ROAS: 1.5-4x (longer sales cycles)
- Minimum viable budget: $5-10K/month

**TikTok**
- Strengths: Younger demographics, viral potential, authentic content
- Best for: Brand awareness, Gen Z/Millennial targeting, creative-driven
- Typical ROAS: 1.5-4x
- Minimum viable budget: $2-5K/month

**YouTube**
- Strengths: Video storytelling, consideration stage, broad reach
- Best for: Brand building, product demos, educational content
- Typical ROAS: 2-4x
- Minimum viable budget: $3-7K/month

**Display/Programmatic**
- Strengths: Scale, retargeting, brand awareness
- Best for: Retargeting, awareness campaigns, omnipresence
- Typical ROAS: 1-3x
- Minimum viable budget: $5-10K/month

### 2. Analyze Historical Performance

If historical data exists:
- What has each channel delivered historically?
- How has performance trended over time?
- What is the efficiency curve (diminishing returns point)?
- Which channels work synergistically?

### 3. Benchmark Against Goals

Compare channel capabilities to objectives:
- **Primary Goal**: Which channels best support this?
- **ROAS Target**: Which channels can achieve this?
- **Volume Requirements**: Which channels have sufficient scale?
- **Speed to Results**: Which channels ramp quickly vs. slowly?

### 4. Develop Channel Mix Strategy

**Budget Allocation Framework**

**70-20-10 Rule** (for mature programs):
- 70% to proven channels with historical performance
- 20% to optimization and scaling of working channels
- 10% to testing new channels and experiments

**Balanced Funnel Approach**:
- 40% to top-of-funnel (awareness) channels
- 30% to mid-funnel (consideration) channels
- 30% to bottom-funnel (conversion) channels

**ROI-Driven Allocation**:
- Weight budget toward highest ROAS channels
- Maintain minimum viability budgets on others
- Reserve 15-20% for testing and optimization

**Recommended Approach**:
Choose allocation model based on:
- Business stage (startup vs. mature)
- Goals (growth vs. efficiency)
- Channel maturity (new vs. established)

### 5. Define Platform-Specific Tactics

For each selected channel:

**Campaign Structure**
- How will campaigns be organized?
- What targeting layers will be used?
- How will budget be distributed?

**Creative Approach**
- What ad formats will be used?
- What creative themes resonate?
- How will creative be tested and refreshed?

**Bidding Strategy**
- Manual vs. automated bidding
- Target ROAS vs. target CPA
- Budget pacing strategy

**Optimization Approach**
- What metrics will trigger optimization?
- How frequently will campaigns be reviewed?
- What are the optimization levers?

### 6. Plan Channel Synergies

Identify how channels work together:
- **Sequential**: Use awareness channels to feed retargeting
- **Complementary**: Combine search (intent) with social (discovery)
- **Reinforcing**: Multi-touch attribution across channels

**Example Multi-Channel Journey**:
1. User discovers brand via Facebook ad (awareness)
2. Visits site, doesn't convert (consideration)
3. Retargeted on Display/YouTube (nurture)
4. Searches brand term on Google (intent)
5. Converts via Google Search ad (conversion)

### 7. Set Success Metrics by Channel

For each channel, define:
- **Primary KPI**: Main success metric (ROAS, CAC, conversions)
- **Secondary KPIs**: Supporting metrics (CTR, CPC, engagement)
- **Target Values**: What success looks like
- **Minimum Acceptable**: When to pause/pivot
- **Optimization Triggers**: When to adjust budget

## Deliverables

1. **Channel Recommendations** - Which channels to use and why
2. **Budget Allocation** - How to distribute budget with rationale
3. **Platform Tactics** - Specific strategies per channel
4. **Success Metrics** - KPIs and targets per channel
5. **Synergy Plan** - How channels work together

## Success Criteria

- Channel mix aligns with business objectives
- Budget allocation is data-informed and defensible
- Each channel has clear tactics and success criteria
- Channels complement rather than cannibalize each other
- Plan includes testing budget for learning
