# Audience Segmentation & Targeting Analysis

## Objective
Develop detailed audience segments with targeting criteria and channel strategies to maximize campaign performance.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Define Segmentation Criteria

**Demographic Segmentation**
- Age, gender, location
- Income, education, occupation
- Household composition, life stage

**Psychographic Segmentation**
- Values and beliefs
- Interests and hobbies
- Lifestyle and personality traits
- Motivations and pain points

**Behavioral Segmentation**
- Purchase behavior and patterns
- Product usage and engagement
- Brand loyalty and advocacy
- Online behavior and content consumption

**Firmographic Segmentation** (B2B)
- Company size and revenue
- Industry and sector
- Job title and seniority
- Decision-making authority

### 2. Identify Audience Segments

Create 2-4 primary audience segments based on:
- Commonalities in characteristics
- Distinct needs and motivations
- Accessibility through marketing channels
- Business value and potential

For each segment, define:
- **Segment Name**: Descriptive, memorable name
- **Size**: Estimated audience size
- **Characteristics**: Detailed profile
- **Needs & Pain Points**: What problems they're solving
- **Purchase Drivers**: What motivates them to buy
- **Media Consumption**: Where they spend time online/offline

### 3. Prioritize Segments

Evaluate each segment on:
- **Market Size**: Total addressable audience
- **Accessibility**: Ease of reaching through marketing
- **Value**: Expected LTV and profitability
- **Competitive Intensity**: How contested is this segment
- **Strategic Fit**: Alignment with business goals

Prioritize segments using scoring framework:
- High Priority: Large size, high value, low competition
- Medium Priority: One dimension is limiting
- Low Priority: Small, low value, or highly competitive

### 4. Develop Targeting Strategies

For each priority segment:

**Platform-Specific Targeting**

**Google Ads**
- Search keywords and intent signals
- Custom intent audiences
- In-market audiences
- Similar audiences
- Demographic targeting

**Facebook/Instagram**
- Core audience targeting (demographics, interests, behaviors)
- Lookalike audiences
- Custom audiences (pixel, email list, engagement)
- Interest stacking strategies

**LinkedIn**
- Job title and function
- Company size and industry
- Seniority and skills
- LinkedIn Groups and interests

**TikTok**
- Age and gender
- Interests and behaviors
- Lookalike audiences
- Custom audiences

### 5. Create Messaging by Segment

For each segment, define:
- **Primary Message**: Core value proposition
- **Supporting Messages**: Secondary benefits
- **Tone & Voice**: Communication style
- **Proof Points**: Credibility and social proof
- **Call-to-Action**: Desired action

Ensure messaging addresses:
- Segment-specific pain points
- Unique motivations and values
- Appropriate level of sophistication
- Platform and context

### 6. Estimate Performance

For each segment, project:
- **Reach**: Total addressable audience on each platform
- **Expected CTR**: Based on benchmarks and historical data
- **Expected Conversion Rate**: Based on segment quality
- **Expected CAC**: Cost to acquire customer
- **Expected LTV**: Lifetime value
- **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Segment profitability

### 7. Develop Testing Plan

Create systematic testing approach:
- **Phase 1**: Test all segments with small budget
- **Phase 2**: Scale top performers, optimize underperformers
- **Phase 3**: Expand winning segments, pause losers

For each test:
- Test duration and budget
- Success criteria (ROAS, CAC, conversion rate)
- Decision rules (when to scale, optimize, or pause)

## Deliverables

1. **Audience Segments** - Detailed profiles for each segment
2. **Targeting Strategies** - Platform-specific targeting parameters
3. **Messaging Framework** - Segment-specific messaging
4. **Performance Projections** - Expected metrics per segment
5. **Testing Plan** - Phased approach to validation

## Success Criteria

- Segments are distinct with clear differentiation
- Targeting criteria are specific and actionable
- Messaging resonates with segment needs
- Performance projections are data-backed
- Testing plan enables rapid learning
