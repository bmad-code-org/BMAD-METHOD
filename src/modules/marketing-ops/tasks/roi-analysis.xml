# Marketing ROI & ROAS Analysis

## Objective
Calculate marketing return on investment (ROI) and return on ad spend (ROAS) to understand profitability and optimize budget allocation.

## Key Metrics Definitions

**ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**
```
ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend
```
Example: $10,000 revenue / $2,000 ad spend = 5x ROAS

**ROI (Return on Investment)**
```
ROI % = (Revenue - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100
```
Example: ($10,000 - $3,000) / $3,000 = 233% ROI

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**
```
CAC = Total Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired
```
Example: $10,000 / 100 customers = $100 CAC

**Lifetime Value (LTV)**
```
LTV = Average Order Value × Purchase Frequency × Customer Lifespan
```
Example: $50 × 4 purchases/year × 3 years = $600 LTV

**LTV:CAC Ratio**
```
LTV:CAC = Lifetime Value / Customer Acquisition Cost
```
Target: Minimum 3:1 (ideally 5:1)

## Analysis Process

### 1. Calculate Overall Performance

**Total Marketing Investment**
Include all costs:
- Media spend (ads, sponsorships)
- Creative production
- Agency/freelance fees
- Marketing tools and software
- Team salaries (allocated %)

**Total Revenue Generated**
- Direct attributed revenue (first-click, last-click)
- Multi-touch attributed revenue
- Include or exclude organic depending on analysis goal

**Calculate Blended Metrics**
- Overall ROAS = Total Revenue / Total Media Spend
- Overall ROI = (Revenue - Total Costs) / Total Costs
- Overall CAC = Total Spend / Total New Customers

### 2. Calculate by Channel

For each marketing channel:

| Channel | Spend | Revenue | ROAS | Conversions | CAC |
|---------|-------|---------|------|-------------|-----|
| Google Search | $10K | $40K | 4.0x | 200 | $50 |
| Facebook | $15K | $45K | 3.0x | 300 | $50 |
| LinkedIn | $8K | $16K | 2.0x | 40 | $200 |
| Email | $2K | $20K | 10.0x | 100 | $20 |
| Organic | $0 | $30K | ∞ | 150 | $0 |

Insights:
- Which channels are most efficient (highest ROAS)?
- Which drive highest volume?
- Where should we allocate more/less budget?

### 3. Calculate by Campaign

For each major campaign:
- Campaign ROAS and ROI
- Performance vs. targets
- Trend over campaign duration
- Efficiency improvements over time

### 4. Analyze Customer Economics

**Calculate LTV**
Method 1: Historical average
- Average order value: $X
- Average purchases per customer: Y
- Average customer lifespan: Z years
- LTV = X × Y × Z

Method 2: Cohort analysis
- Track cohorts by acquisition month
- Calculate actual revenue per cohort over time
- Project future revenue based on retention curves

**LTV:CAC Ratio by Channel**
| Channel | CAC | LTV | LTV:CAC | Payback Period |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|----------------|
| Google | $50 | $300 | 6.0x | 2 months |
| Facebook | $75 | $200 | 2.7x | 4 months |
| LinkedIn | $200 | $800 | 4.0x | 3 months |

Interpretation:
- **LTV:CAC < 1**: Losing money on each customer
- **LTV:CAC 1-3**: Marginal, may not cover overhead
- **LTV:CAC 3-5**: Healthy, sustainable
- **LTV:CAC > 5**: Excellent, room to invest more

**Payback Period**
```
Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue per Customer)
```
Target: < 12 months (ideally < 6 months)

### 5. Attribution Analysis

**Compare Attribution Models**
- **Last Click**: Full credit to final touchpoint
- **First Click**: Full credit to initial touchpoint
- **Linear**: Equal credit across all touchpoints
- **Time Decay**: More credit to recent touchpoints
- **Position-Based**: Credit to first and last (40/40/20)
- **Data-Driven**: Algorithmic based on conversion paths

Analyze:
- How does ROAS change across models?
- Which channels benefit from multi-touch attribution?
- What does customer journey reveal about channel roles?

### 6. Incremental Lift Analysis

**Test Incrementality**
Not all attributed revenue is incremental:
- Would they have converted anyway?
- Are we cannibalizing organic traffic?
- What is true incremental lift from marketing?

**Methods**:
- Geographic holdout tests
- Conversion lift studies (platform-provided)
- Media mix modeling
- Before/after analysis

### 7. Optimize Budget Allocation

**Marginal ROAS Analysis**
- What is ROAS at current spend level?
- What happens if we increase budget 20%?
- What happens if we decrease budget 20%?
- Where is the efficiency curve flattening?

**Reallocation Scenarios**
Model what-if scenarios:
- Scenario 1: Shift $5K from LinkedIn to Google
- Scenario 2: Increase top-performing campaigns by 30%
- Scenario 3: Cut bottom 20% of spend, reallocate to top 20%

Calculate expected impact on:
- Total revenue
- Total ROAS
- Total conversions

**Optimal Allocation Formula**
Allocate budget where:
```
Marginal ROAS Channel A = Marginal ROAS Channel B = ... = Target ROAS
```

## Deliverables

1. **ROI Dashboard** - Summary metrics and trends
2. **Channel Performance** - ROAS, ROI, CAC by channel
3. **Customer Economics** - LTV, CAC, payback period analysis
4. **Attribution Comparison** - Multi-model attribution results
5. **Optimization Recommendations** - Budget reallocation scenarios

## Success Criteria

- All revenue properly attributed to marketing sources
- Customer economics (LTV, CAC, payback) clearly understood
- Channel efficiency benchmarked and compared
- Budget optimization opportunities identified and quantified
- Recommendations are data-backed with projected impact
