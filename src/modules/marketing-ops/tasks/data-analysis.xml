# Marketing Data Analysis Task

## Objective
Conduct systematic data analysis to answer specific business questions and generate actionable insights.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Define the Question

**Clarify the Business Question**
- What specific question needs answering?
- Why does this matter to the business?
- What decision will this analysis inform?
- What time period is relevant?

**Examples**:
- "Why did conversion rate drop 20% last month?"
- "Which marketing channels drive the highest LTV customers?"
- "What is the optimal budget allocation across channels?"

### 2. Identify Required Data

**Data Sources Needed**
- Website analytics (GA4, Adobe Analytics)
- Advertising platforms (Google Ads, Facebook, LinkedIn)
- CRM and sales data
- Email marketing metrics
- Attribution data
- Customer surveys or feedback

**Data Quality Check**
- Is data complete for the analysis period?
- Are there any known data quality issues?
- Are metrics defined consistently across sources?
- What data gaps exist and how will they be handled?

### 3. Collect & Prepare Data

**Data Extraction**
- Pull data from all required sources
- Export with consistent date ranges and granularity
- Include all necessary dimensions (channel, campaign, segment, etc.)

**Data Cleaning**
- Remove duplicates and outliers
- Handle missing values
- Standardize naming conventions
- Validate data accuracy (spot checks)

**Data Transformation**
- Calculate derived metrics (ROAS, LTV, CAC, etc.)
- Create segments and cohorts
- Aggregate to appropriate level of analysis
- Join data from multiple sources

### 4. Conduct Exploratory Analysis

**Descriptive Statistics**
- Calculate mean, median, mode for key metrics
- Identify distribution and variance
- Spot trends over time
- Find correlations between variables

**Visualize Patterns**
- Time series charts for trends
- Bar/column charts for comparisons
- Scatter plots for correlations
- Heatmaps for multi-dimensional patterns

**Identify Anomalies**
- Unusual spikes or drops
- Seasonal patterns
- Day-of-week effects
- Event-driven changes

### 5. Perform Statistical Analysis

**Hypothesis Testing**
- State null and alternative hypotheses
- Choose appropriate statistical test
- Calculate p-values and confidence intervals
- Determine statistical significance (p < 0.05)

**Regression Analysis** (when appropriate)
- Identify dependent and independent variables
- Test for multicollinearity
- Interpret coefficients and R-squared
- Validate model assumptions

**Segmentation Analysis**
- Group customers/campaigns by characteristics
- Compare performance across segments
- Identify high-performing segments
- Find commonalities in top performers

### 6. Synthesize Insights

**Answer the Original Question**
- Provide clear, data-backed answer
- Quantify the impact where possible
- Explain confidence level in findings

**Uncover Additional Insights**
- What unexpected patterns emerged?
- What other questions does this raise?
- What hypotheses should be tested next?

**Provide Context**
- How do results compare to benchmarks?
- What external factors may have influenced results?
- What limitations exist in the analysis?

### 7. Develop Recommendations

**Translate Insights to Action**
- Specific actions to take based on findings
- Prioritize recommendations by impact and effort
- Estimate expected outcomes where possible
- Define success metrics for recommendations

**Implementation Guidance**
- Who should own each action?
- What resources are required?
- What timeline is realistic?
- How will success be measured?

## Analysis Framework

### Root Cause Analysis
When investigating performance changes:
1. **What changed?** - Quantify the change
2. **When did it change?** - Pinpoint timing
3. **Where did it change?** - Isolate segment/channel
4. **Why did it change?** - Test hypotheses
5. **What should we do?** - Recommend actions

### Performance Driver Analysis
When optimizing performance:
1. **Top Performers** - What's working well and why?
2. **Bottom Performers** - What's underperforming and why?
3. **Growth Opportunities** - Where's the biggest upside?
4. **Quick Wins** - What can improve immediately?
5. **Strategic Bets** - What longer-term changes are needed?

## Deliverables

1. **Analysis Report** - Findings, insights, and recommendations
2. **Data Visualizations** - Charts and graphs supporting insights
3. **Statistical Results** - Test results and confidence levels
4. **Action Plan** - Prioritized recommendations with expected impact

## Quality Standards

- All findings must be data-backed with sources cited
- Statistical significance required for key claims
- Visualizations must be clear and properly labeled
- Recommendations must be specific and actionable
- Assumptions and limitations clearly stated
