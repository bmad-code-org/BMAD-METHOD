## Part 4: Practicalities

**Everything you need to know before starting**

---

## Prerequisites

### What Skills You Need

**Required (you probably already have these):**

- Basic design thinking and UX principles
- Ability to sketch interfaces (hand-drawn or digital)
- Understanding of user needs and business goals
- Willingness to think deeply about WHY

**NOT required:**

- ❌ Coding skills
- ❌ Advanced technical knowledge

## Time Investment

### How Long Does It Take?

**Total tutorial time:** ~10 hours

- Spread over days or weeks at your own pace
- Each chapter: 30-40 minutes
- Practice exercises: 1-2 hours per chapter

**Breakdown:**

- **Week 1-2:** Foundation chapters (0-2.3) - Understanding the methodology
- **Week 3-4:** Core workflow (4.1-4.6) - Learning specification creation
- **Week 5-6:** Advanced topics (5.1-6.1) - Design systems and handoff
- **Ongoing:** Practice with your own projects

**Real-world application:**

- First project with WDS: 2-3x slower than your usual process (learning curve)
- Second project: Same speed as traditional approach
- Third project onwards: 3-5x faster with better quality

## Tools You'll Need

### Essential Tools

**For sketching:**

- Paper and pen (seriously, this works best)
- OR digital sketching tool (Excalidraw, Figma, iPad + Pencil)

**For AI assistance:**

- Access to Claude, ChatGPT, or similar AI assistant
- Free tier is sufficient to start

**For documentation:**

- Text editor (VS Code recommended, but any will work)
- Markdown support (built into most modern editors)

**For collaboration:**

- Git/GitHub (optional but recommended)
- Shared folder system (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)

**Total cost to get started:** $0-20/month

- Free tier AI tools work fine
- Paid AI subscriptions ($20/month) provide better experience but aren't required

## What You'll Create

### Your First WDS Project

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created:

**1. Complete Project Brief**

- Vision and goals clearly defined
- Stakeholders and constraints documented
- Foundation for all design decisions

**2. Trigger Map**

- Target groups identified and prioritized
- User triggers and outcomes mapped
- Features prioritized by impact

**3. Scenario Specifications**

- At least one complete user scenario
- Why-based specifications for key components
- AI-ready documentation

**4. Design System Foundation**

- Design tokens extracted from your specs

## Common Questions

### FAQ

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**
A: No. WDS is about design thinking and specifications. AI handles the implementation.

**Q: What if I don't have a project to practice with?**
A: The tutorial includes practice exercises. You can also use a hypothetical project or redesign an existing app.

**Q: Can I use this with my current design process?**
A: Yes! WDS complements existing processes. Many designers integrate it gradually.

**Q: Is this only for digital products?**
A: WDS is optimized for digital products, but the principles apply to any design work.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Each chapter includes clear examples and guidance. The AI assistant can help clarify concepts as you learn.
