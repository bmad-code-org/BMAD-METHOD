## What You'll Do

1. Create a Trigger Map
2. Initialize a scenario
3. Sketch your first page
4. Generate specifications

**Time: 5 minutes**

## Step 1: Start WDS

```bash
npm start
```

Agent: "Welcome to Whiteport Design Studio! Ready to start?"

---

## Step 2: Create Trigger Map

```
You: "Let's create a Trigger Map for a dog walking app"

Agent: "Great! Who is your primary target group?"
You: "Parents who struggle with family dog care coordination"

Agent: "What triggers their need?"
You: "Family conflict over who walks the dog"

Agent: "What outcome do they want?"
You: "Accountability without nagging"
```

**✅ Trigger Map created**

---

## Step 3: Initialize Scenario

```
Agent: "What feature delivers the most value to parents?"
You: "Family dog walk calendar"

Agent: "Where do they first encounter this?"
You: "Google search - frustrated with conflict"

Agent: "What's the shortest path to mutual success?"
You: "Landing → Sign up → Family setup → Calendar → First walk"
```

**✅ Scenario initialized**

---

## Step 4: Sketch First Page

```
Agent: "Let's start with the Landing page. Upload your sketch."
You: [Upload sketch]

Agent: "I see: Header, Hero section, How it works, Sign up CTA.
        Should I analyze these sections?"
You: "Yes"
```

**✅ Sketch analyzed**

---

## Step 5: Generate Specifications

```
Agent: "Based on your Trigger Map:
        - Target: Parents (tired of nagging)
        - Trigger: Family conflict

        For the Hero section, I suggest:
        Headline: 'Stop Nagging. Start Harmony.'

        Does this address their frustration?"

You: "Perfect!"
```

**✅ Specifications generated**

You created **why-based specifications** in 5 minutes:

- Connected to user psychology (Trigger Map)
- Grounded in real context (Scenario Init)
- Generated with AI assistance (Agent collaboration)
