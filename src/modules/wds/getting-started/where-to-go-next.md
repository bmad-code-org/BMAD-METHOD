### 🚀 Start Your Project

**[Workflows Guide](../WDS-WORKFLOWS-GUIDE.md)**

Step-by-step workflows for:

**Phase 1: Trigger Mapping**  
Understand WHO your users are, WHAT triggers their needs, and WHY your business exists. Create a Trigger Map that identifies target groups, their pain points, desired outcomes, and prioritized features. This becomes the foundation for all design decisions.  
→ [Watch Tutorial: Trigger Map Walkthrough](../tutorial/04-trigger-map-walkthrough.md)

**Phase 2: Information Architecture**  
Structure your content hierarchy and navigation based on user mental models and business goals. Organize information so users can find what they need intuitively, without cognitive overload.  
→ [Learn more in BMad Method Overview](../tutorial/03-bmad-method-overview.md)

**Phase 3: Interaction Design**  
Sketch user flows and state transitions. Design the journey from trigger moment to mutual success. Create visual representations of how users move through your product and how the interface responds to their actions.  
→ [Watch Tutorial: Scenario Initialization](../tutorial/05-scenario-init-walkthrough.md)

**Phase 4: UX Specifications**  
Transform sketches into why-based specifications that AI can implement correctly while preserving your design intent. Document not just WHAT to build, but WHY each decision was made, ensuring AI follows your reasoning instead of making "helpful" mistakes.  
→ [Watch Tutorial: Sketch to Specification](../tutorial/06-sketch-to-spec-walkthrough.md) | [Why-Based Specs](../tutorial/07-why-based-specifications.md)

**Best for:** Hands-on learning with a real project

**Time:** Ongoing (project-based)
