## Why Alignment Matters

When you're building something that makes the world a better place, and you need others involved, you need alignment first.

**Without alignment:**
- Misunderstandings about scope
- Disagreements about budget
- Unclear expectations
- Projects fail or stall

**With alignment:**
- Everyone understands the idea, why, what, how, budget, and commitment
- Clear expectations from the start
- Projects succeed because everyone is on the same page

## The 6 Elements of Alignment

When others are involved, you need alignment on:

1. **The Idea** - What are we building?
2. **Why** - Why should it be done?
3. **What** - What does it contain?
4. **How** - How will it be executed?
5. **Budget** - What resources are needed?
6. **Commitment** - What are we willing to commit to make it happen?

## The Alignment Process

1. **Create alignment document** - Work through 10 sections
2. **Share & negotiate** - Present to stakeholders, gather feedback
3. **Iterate** - Make changes until everyone is on board
4. **Get acceptance** - Once everyone agrees, you have alignment
5. **Secure commitment** - Generate signoff document to formalize

## Key Takeaway

**WDS helps with alignment** - getting everyone on the same page before starting work. The alignment phase is collaborative and iterative. Once approved, the signoff document formalizes that commitment.
