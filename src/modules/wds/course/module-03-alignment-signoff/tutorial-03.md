# Tutorial 03: Alignment & Signoff

**Hands-on guide to getting stakeholders aligned and securing commitment**

---

## Overview

This tutorial walks you through creating an alignment document (pitch) and securing formal signoff from stakeholders before starting your project.

**Time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Module 02 completed (WDS installed)  
**What you'll create:** Alignment document and signoff document

---

## What You'll Learn

- How to articulate your idea clearly (Idea, Why, What, How, Budget, Commitment)
- Creating a compelling alignment document
- Negotiating and iterating until acceptance
- Generating appropriate signoff documents
- Understanding contract clauses and best practices

---

## Before You Start

**You'll need:**
- A project idea that needs stakeholder alignment
- 45-60 minutes of focused time
- Access to stakeholder information (if available)
- Optional: Existing communications/documents from stakeholders

**AI Support:**
- **Saga WDS Analyst Agent** will guide you through the process
- She'll help you clarify your situation
- Guide you through creating the alignment document
- Help generate the signoff document after acceptance

---

## Step 1: Understand Your Situation (5 min)

**First, clarify your scenario:**

- **Consultant proposing to client** → You'll create a Project Contract
- **Business hiring suppliers** → You'll create a Service Agreement
- **Manager/employee seeking approval** → You'll create a Signoff Document
- **Doing it yourself** → Skip this tutorial, go to Module 04: Create Project Brief

**Your scenario:** [Write your scenario here]

---

## Step 2: Extract Information (Optional - 10 min)

**If you have existing communications or documents:**

Share emails, chats, or documents with stakeholders. Saga will extract:
- Realizations or observations mentioned
- Requirements discussed
- Concerns raised
- Context and background
- Timeline or urgency
- Budget or constraints

**If you don't have communications:** That's fine! Move to Step 3.

---

## Step 3: Explore Alignment Sections (20-30 min)

**Work through these 10 sections** (in whatever order makes sense):

1. **The Realization** - What we've realized needs attention
2. **Why It Matters** - Why this matters and who we help
3. **How We See It Working** - Brief overview of the solution approach
4. **Paths We Explored** - 2-3 solution options we considered
5. **Recommended Solution** - Preferred approach and why
6. **The Path Forward** - How the work will be done (WDS phases and practical approach)
7. **The Value We'll Create** - What happens if we DO build this
8. **Cost of Inaction** - What happens if we DON'T build this
9. **Our Commitment** - Resources needed and potential risks
10. **Summary** - Summary of key points

**Saga will guide you** through each section, asking one question at a time and reflecting back what she hears.

### Best Practice: Realization Section with Evidence

**When exploring "The Realization" section**, Saga will help you:

1. **Identify the realization** - What have you realized needs attention?
2. **Confirm it's real** - Is there evidence that supports this?
3. **Gather evidence** - What proof do you have?

**Soft Evidence** (qualitative):
- Testimonials: "Customers tell us..."
- Complaints: "Support tickets show..."
- Observations: "We've noticed that..."
- Interviews: "In user interviews, people mentioned..."

**Hard Evidence** (quantitative):
- Statistics: "45% of users..."
- Analytics: "Bounce rate increased 25%..."
- Surveys: "78% rated this as 'difficult'..."
- Logs: "Server logs show 500 errors occur..."

**Example:**
> "Our customers consistently report frustration with checkout (testimonials). Analytics confirm: 45% abandon checkout, taking 12 minutes on average - 3x longer than industry standard (statistics). Support tickets show 60% of complaints are about checkout complexity (complaints), and our survey found 78% rated it as 'difficult' (survey results)."

**If you don't have evidence yet:** That's okay! Acknowledge this and propose gathering evidence as part of the project.

## Step 4: Synthesize Alignment Document (5 min)

**Saga will help you create:**

`docs/1-project-brief/pitch.md`

- Clear, brief, readable in 2-3 minutes
- Makes the case for the project
- Ready to share with stakeholders

**Review together:** Does this capture your idea? Anything to adjust?

---

## Step 5: Share & Negotiate (Variable time)

**Share with stakeholders:**
- Present the alignment document
- Gather feedback
- Make changes and iterate
- Update until everyone is on board

**Remember:** This phase is collaborative - negotiate and iterate until everyone is aligned.

---

## Step 6: Get Acceptance (Variable time)

**Once stakeholders accept:**
- Everyone is aligned on Idea, Why, What, How, Budget, Commitment
- You have buy-in before starting detailed work
- Ready to secure formal commitment

---

## Step 7: Generate Signoff Document (15-20 min)

**After acceptance, Saga will help you create:**

**Choose your document type:**
1. **Project Contract** - For consultant → client
2. **Service Agreement** - For business → suppliers
3. **Signoff Document** - For internal company projects
   - *Optional: Upload your company's signoff format*

**Saga will guide you through:**
- Scope of work
- Investment and timeline
- Payment terms (with upfront payment guidance for fixed-price contracts)
- Confidentiality clause
- Not-to-Exceed clause (prevents scope creep)
- Legal jurisdiction and contract language
- Work initiation terms
- Change order process
- Termination clause
- Intellectual property ownership
- Dispute resolution

**Output:** `docs/1-project-brief/[contract/service-agreement/signoff].md`

## Step 8: Finalize & Proceed (5 min)

**Once signoff document is finalized:**
- ✅ Alignment achieved
- ✅ Commitment secured
- ✅ Foundation established

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I always need this?**  
A: No - skip if you're doing it yourself or have full autonomy.

**Q: Can I skip the signoff document?**  
A: Yes - the alignment document might be enough. Signoff formalizes the commitment.

**Q: What if stakeholders want changes?**  
A: That's normal! Iterate and negotiate until everyone is on board.

**Q: How long does negotiation take?**  
A: Variable - could be hours or days. The alignment document helps speed this up.
