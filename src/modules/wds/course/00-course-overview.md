- The linchpin designer who makes things happen
- The gatekeeper between business goals and user needs
- The irreplaceable designer in the AI era

**Time investment:** ~10 hours total
**Result:** Complete mastery of WDS methodology from project brief to AI-ready specifications

## Who Created WDS?

**Mårten Angner** is a UX designer and founder of Whiteport, a design and development agency based in Sweden. After years of working with AI tools, Mårten observed that traditional design handoffs were breaking down. Designers would create beautiful mockups, hand them off to developers, and watch their creative intent get lost in translation.

Mårten developed WDS to solve this problem - a methodology where design thinking is preserved and amplified through AI implementation, not diluted and lost.

**The Mission:** WDS is completely free and open-source. Mårten created it as a **plugin module for BMad Method** - an open-source AI-augmented development framework - to give designers everywhere the tools they need to thrive in the AI era.
