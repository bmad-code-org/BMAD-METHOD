## Prompt

Create an engaging 15-minute podcast conversation between two hosts discussing the WDS (Whiteport Design Studio) course getting started guide. 

**Host 1 (The Skeptic):** A designer who's heard about WDS but is uncertain about investing time in another methodology. Asks practical questions about prerequisites, time commitment, and real-world value.

**Host 2 (The Advocate):** A designer who understands WDS deeply and can explain why it matters, especially in the AI era. Enthusiastic but grounded in practical benefits.

**Conversation structure:**

### 1. Opening (2 min) - Hook the listener

Start with The Skeptic expressing fatigue: "Another design methodology? I've been through Lean UX, Design Thinking, Jobs to be Done... what makes WDS different?" 

The Advocate responds with the core paradigm shift that changes everything: "Here's what's different - in WDS, the design becomes the specification. The specification becomes the product. The code is just the printout - the projection to the end user." Explain that this isn't just another process overlay, it's a fundamental shift in how designers work with AI.

**Background context:** The Advocate explains that WDS (Whiteport Design Studio) was created by Mårten Angner, a UX designer and founder of Whiteport, a design and development agency from Sweden. Mårten developed WDS as a plugin module for the BMad Method - an open-source AI-augmented development framework. The goal was to give designers everywhere free and open-source access to AI agents specifically tailored for design work. After years of working with AI tools, Mårten realized that traditional design handoffs were breaking down. Designers needed a methodology where their thinking could be preserved and amplified through AI implementation, not lost in translation. WDS emerged from real-world projects where designers could deliver deeper, more complete work while becoming the strategic thinkers their teams need. By making it open-source and integrating it with BMad Method, Mårten ensures that any designer can access these powerful AI-augmented workflows without cost barriers.

Introduce the context: we're in the AI era where AI can generate mockups in seconds, follow design systems perfectly, and iterate endlessly. The question isn't whether AI will change design - it already has. The question is: which side of the line are you on? Are you doing factory work that AI can replace, or are you a linchpin designer who makes things happen?

Give a quick overview: this conversation will cover what you actually need to start (spoiler: you already have it), the simple three-step setup to begin, the powerful deliverables you'll create, and why designers who master WDS become indispensable rather than replaceable.

### 2. Prerequisites Discussion (3 min) - Address concerns

The Skeptic jumps in with the practical concerns: "Okay, but what do I actually need? Do I need to learn to code? What tools do I need to buy? How much time are we talking about?"

The Advocate breaks it down clearly. For skills, if you can design interfaces and explain your thinking, you're ready. That's it. You need basic design thinking and UX principles - which you already have if you're working as a designer. You need to be able to sketch interfaces, whether that's on paper or digitally. And you need to be willing to think deeply about WHY, not just WHAT.

What you DON'T need is crucial: no coding skills, no advanced technical knowledge, no experience with AI tools, no formal design education. The truth is simple - if you can design interfaces and explain your thinking, you have everything you need to start.

For tools, there's an important learning curve to discuss honestly. Paper and pen work best for sketching (seriously). Or use any digital sketching tool you're comfortable with - Excalidraw, Figma, iPad with Pencil.

Here's the real cost: You need to learn how to operate an IDE like Cursor or VS Code. This is a learning curve - it's not just opening Figma anymore. You'll be delivering your designs through GitHub, which means learning version control and collaborating in a developer's environment. The Advocate is honest: "This feels uncomfortable at first. You're stepping into developer territory."

**The financial cost:** An AI-powered IDE like Cursor costs $15-20 per month for smaller projects, scaling up to around $80 per month for large enterprise projects where you're designing non-stop every day. This is in addition to your existing design tools.

But here's what you gain: You've removed one of the biggest barriers between designers and developers. Your designs now live in the same place as the code. No more handoff nightmares. No more 'lost in translation' moments. You've created the perfect environment for your designs to flourish - where specifications become implementation seamlessly.

**The game-changer:** You can now create fully standalone frontend prototypes to refine your designs and conduct usability testing - without waiting for a tech team to set things up. You're no longer blocked by development schedules. And with time, you'll be able to deliver parts of the frontend work for the final product within the same pipeline. You're not just designing anymore - you're building.

Time investment is realistic: about 10 hours for the course content, spread over days or weeks at your own pace. Each module takes 30-40 minutes. Practice exercises add 1-2 hours per module. But learning the IDE and GitHub workflow? Add another 5-10 hours of getting comfortable with the tools.

The Skeptic asks the common questions: "What if I don't have a project to practice with?" The Advocate explains that the course includes practice exercises, and you can use a hypothetical project or redesign an existing app. "Can I use this with my current design process?" Yes - WDS complements existing processes. Many designers integrate it gradually rather than replacing everything at once.

### 3. Getting Started - Three Simple Steps (5 min) - Just follow along

The Skeptic asks: "Okay, I'm interested. But where do I actually start? Is this complicated to set up?"

The Advocate responds: "Here's the beautiful part - it's three simple steps, and the course walks you through everything. No complex decisions, no choosing paths. Just follow along."

**Step 1: Install your IDE** - Download Cursor or VS Code. The course has clear instructions. Yes, it feels different from Figma at first, but you'll be comfortable within a few hours. This is your new design workspace where specifications live alongside code.

**Step 2: Clone the WDS repository locally** - One command in your terminal. The course shows you exactly how. Now you have all the templates, examples, and course materials on your machine. Everything you need is right there.

**Step 3: Create your first project in GitHub** - The course guides you through setting up your first WDS project repository. This is where your design specifications will live. GitHub might feel intimidating, but you're just creating a folder for your work - the course makes it simple.

The Advocate emphasizes: "That's it. Three steps, maybe 30 minutes total. Then you start designing. The course instructions guide you through every module. You don't need to figure anything out on your own."

The Skeptic asks: "But what if I get stuck? What if something doesn't make sense?"

The Advocate: "There's a dedicated channel for designers in the BMad Discord community. Real designers using WDS every day. Ask questions, share your work, get feedback. You're never alone in this."

### 4. The Deliverables - What You'll Actually Create (4 min) - This is the exciting part

The Skeptic asks the crucial question: "Okay, but what will I actually create? What are these deliverables everyone talks about?"

The Advocate gets excited: "This is where it gets really good. By following the course, you'll create four major artifacts that transform how you work. Let me walk you through each one because these aren't just documents - they're your new superpowers."

**First: Your Project Brief** - This isn't a typical brief. It's your project's strategic foundation with vision and goals clearly defined, stakeholders and constraints documented, and the foundation for every design decision you'll make. This becomes your north star. When stakeholders ask 'why did we build it this way?' you point to the brief. When developers need context, it's all there. When you need to defend a design decision, the reasoning is documented. This is strategic thinking made visible.

**Second: Your Trigger Map** - This is pure strategic gold. You've identified and prioritized target groups, mapped user triggers and outcomes, and prioritized features by impact. This tells you exactly what to build and why. No more guessing what features matter. No more building things nobody uses. The trigger map creates a logical chain of reasoning between the business goals and the users' goals that is traceable to every feature and piece of content in the product. When product managers ask 'what should we build next?' you have the answer, backed by user psychology and business impact.

**Third: Scenario Specifications** - This is where your brilliance comes to life. Here's the magic: AI agents in WDS support you throughout the design process - helping you explore what to draw, discussing design solutions with pros and cons, collaborating as you finalize your design. Then, once you've made all your design decisions, the agents become genuinely interested in capturing every nuance of your thinking in text. They help you document everything your sketch can't convey - why every object is placed exactly where it is, how it connects to the wider picture, what alternatives you considered and rejected. These Conceptual Specifications give your designs eternal life. It's your thinking, your creative integrity, captured and preserved. Not factory work - this is where your design brilliance becomes immortal.

**Fourth: Your Design System Foundation** - Design tokens extracted from your specs, component patterns identified, and reusable architecture defined. This scales your design decisions across the entire product. Every color, every spacing decision, every interaction pattern - documented and reusable. You're not just designing one screen anymore. You're creating a system that scales infinitely. This is how your design thinking compounds over time.

The Advocate pauses for emphasis: "These four deliverables transform you from someone who makes mockups to someone who creates strategic design systems. Each one builds on the last. Each one amplifies your impact. And here's the key - the course walks you through creating all of them, step by step, for your own project."

The Skeptic asks: "But wait - writing specifications sounds like factory work. Isn't that exactly what we're trying to avoid?" The Advocate responds with passion: "That's the beautiful reframe! In WDS, you're not grinding out documentation. The AI agents are your creative partners. They help you think through design solutions, explore alternatives, discuss trade-offs. Then - and this is crucial - they're genuinely fascinated by your thinking. They want to capture every nuance, every decision, every insight. It's like having a brilliant assistant who's obsessed with preserving your creative genius for eternity. The specifications aren't factory work - they're the point where your brilliance comes to life in a form that gives your designs eternal life. Your thinking, your creative integrity, captured perfectly so it can never be lost."

### 5. The AI Era Reality Check (2 min) - Address the elephant in the room

The Skeptic voices the fear many designers have: "Let's be real here. Won't AI just replace designers anyway? Why invest time learning anything when AI is getting better every day?"

The Advocate addresses this head-on with the factory mindset versus linchpin mindset concept from Seth Godin's book "Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?" For over a century, we've been trained to be cogs in a machine - show up, follow instructions, do your part, go home. Replaceable. Interchangeable. Traditional design work follows this exact pattern: get a brief, create mockups, hand off to developers, hope for the best. That's factory work, just with Figma instead of an assembly line.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI is really, really good at factory work. If your value as a designer comes from creating predictable outputs based on clear instructions, you're competing with something that's faster, more consistent, and infinitely scalable. AI can generate mockups instantly, follow design systems perfectly, iterate through hundreds of variations without fatigue, and work 24/7 at the same quality level.

But - and this is crucial - AI cannot be a linchpin. It can't walk into chaos and create order. It can't sense when a client is asking for the wrong thing. It can't connect a business goal to a psychological insight to a technical constraint and come up with something nobody expected but everyone loves.

The internet is drowning in what we call "AI slop" - generic interfaces that look fine but feel dead. Products that check all the boxes but have no soul. This is what happens when you let AI do the thinking. But here's the brutal market reality: bad products used to fail after launch. Now bad products never even get to start. Users have infinite options. They can smell soulless design from a mile away. If your product doesn't immediately feel different, feel right, feel like someone actually cared - it's dead on arrival.

This is the opportunity. Linchpin designers do what AI fundamentally cannot do: they give products a soul. They navigate five dimensions of thinking simultaneously - business goals, user psychology, product strategy, technical constraints, and design execution - and find the human truth at the intersection. They make judgment calls that create emotional resonance. They build trust through thoughtful decisions. They care about the outcome in a way that shows in every interaction.

The Advocate explains the transformation: "Designers who master WDS become strategic thinkers who deliver complete value. But here's the crucial difference from traditional AI tools - in WDS, AI agents are your creative partners, not your replacements. They help you explore design solutions, discuss pros and cons, support your thinking process. Then they become fascinated documentarians of your brilliance - capturing every nuance of your creative decisions in Conceptual Specifications that give your designs eternal life."

The key insight: with WDS, your design contribution completely replaces prompting. You make design decisions with AI as your thinking partner. Then AI helps capture your creative integrity in text - not factory work, but preserving your genius. The result is an absolute goldmine for everyone - providing clarity that works like clockwork, replacing hours of pointless back-and-forth prompting. You remain in the loop as the skilled, experienced designer who evaluates AI's work, catches its confident mistakes, and ensures what ships actually makes sense.

### 6. Getting Support & Next Steps (1 min) - You're ready

The Skeptic asks: "Okay, I'm convinced. What's my actual next step right now?"

The Advocate: "Right now? Go to the WDS GitHub repository. Start with Module 01 - Why WDS Matters. Three lessons, 30 minutes total. You'll understand the problem you're solving, the solution WDS provides, and the transformation you'll experience.

Then follow the setup instructions - install your IDE, clone the repo, create your first project. The course walks you through everything. When you get stuck - and you will, we all do - jump into the BMad Discord. There's a dedicated channel for designers. Real people using WDS every day who remember what it's like to start.

The course includes detailed examples and clear guidance for every module. Practice exercises come with clear success criteria so you know if you're on track. You're never guessing if you're doing it right."

The Skeptic: "And this is all free?"

The Advocate: "Completely free and open-source. The only cost is your IDE subscription - $15-20 per month for Cursor. That's it. No course fees, no hidden costs, no upsells. Mårten created WDS to help designers thrive in the AI era, not to sell you something."

### 7. Closing (1 min) - Clear call to action

The Advocate brings it home with the paradigm shift: "Remember this - the design becomes the specification. The specification becomes the product. The code is just the printout - the projection to the end user."

The Skeptic, now convinced, summarizes: "So I already have the skills I need, the setup takes 30 minutes, the course walks me through everything, I'll create four major deliverables that transform how I work, and there's a community to support me when I get stuck. And it makes me indispensable instead of replaceable in the AI era."

The Advocate confirms: "Exactly. Three simple steps to start. Ten hours of learning. Four powerful deliverables. A lifetime of being indispensable. The question isn't whether to learn WDS. The question is: which side of the line do you want to be on? Factory worker or linchpin designer? Replaceable or indispensable?"

The clear next step: Go to the WDS GitHub repository right now. Start with Module 01 - Why WDS Matters. Then follow the setup instructions. Then start creating your first deliverable - your Project Brief. The course guides you through everything.

The Skeptic ends with: "I'm in. Let's do this."

The Advocate adds: "Perfect! See you in the BMad Discord. Can't wait to see what you create."
