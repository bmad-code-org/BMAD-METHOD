- Project Brief (strategic foundation)
- Trigger Map (user psychology + business impact)
- Scenario Specifications (your thinking captured for eternity)
- Design System Foundation (scaling your decisions)

🔹 **Conceptual Specifications** - Where your creative brilliance becomes immortal

## The Choice

You're standing at the most important moment in design history.

**Linchpin work** - strategic, irreplaceable, where your brilliance becomes immortal

The question isn't whether AI will change design - it already has.

The question is: **Which side of the line are you on?**
