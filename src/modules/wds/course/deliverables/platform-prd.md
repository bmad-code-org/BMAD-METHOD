# Deliverable 04: Platform PRD & Architecture

**Define the technical foundation - bridge design vision with technical reality**

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Platform PRD (Product Requirements Document) defines the technical architecture and infrastructure decisions:
- Data models and database structure
- System architecture and tech stack
- APIs and integrations
- Security and performance requirements
- Technical constraints and decisions

**Created by:** Idunn the WDS Technical Architect Agent  
**When:** Phase 4 - After Trigger Map, before UX design (or in parallel)  
**Format:** Structured PRD document + architecture diagrams

## What's Included

### 1. System Architecture
- High-level architecture diagram
- Technology stack decisions (and rationale)
- Infrastructure requirements
- Deployment strategy

### 2. Data Models
- Entity relationships
- Database schema
- Data flow diagrams
- Storage requirements

### 3. API Specifications
- Endpoint definitions
- Request/response formats
- Authentication & authorization
- Rate limiting and caching

### 4. Technical Requirements
- Performance benchmarks
- Security requirements
- Scalability considerations
- Browser/device support

### 5. Integration Points
- Third-party services
- External APIs
- Authentication providers
- Analytics and monitoring

### 6. Technical Risks
- Known challenges
- Mitigation strategies
- Technical debt considerations

## How to Create This

**Hands-on Tutorial:** [Module 06: Platform Architecture](../module-06-platform-architecture/tutorial-06.md)

**Workflow Reference:** [Platform PRD Workflow](../../workflows/3-prd-platform/)

---

## Why This Matters

Without Platform Architecture:
- Designers create UX that's technically impossible
- Developers make inconsistent tech decisions
- Costly rework when design meets reality
- Security and performance as afterthoughts

With Platform Architecture:
- Realistic design constraints from day one
- Technical decisions documented and justified
- Developers aligned on approach
- Foundation for sustainable growth
