# Deliverable 07: Design Delivery PRD

**Package everything developers need - turn specs into buildable epics and stories**

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Design Delivery PRD organizes your page specifications and design system into developer-ready documentation:
- Epic breakdown (major features)
- User stories (specific tasks)
- Acceptance criteria
- Technical dependencies
- Implementation sequence
- Links back to page specifications

**Created by:** Idunn the WDS Technical Architect Agent  
**When:** Phase 7 - After page specs and design system are complete  
**Format:** PRD document with epics, stories, and implementation guide

## What's Included

### 1. Implementation Strategy
- Development phases
- Priority order
- Technical dependencies
- Resource requirements
- Timeline estimates

### 2. Epics
For each major feature:
- Epic name and description
- Business value
- User stories included
- Technical dependencies
- Acceptance criteria at epic level

### 3. User Stories
For each story:
- Story format: "As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"
- Acceptance criteria (specific, testable)
- Linked page specifications
- Design system components used
- Technical notes
- Estimation (story points or time)

### 4. Component Mapping
- Which design system components are needed
- Where components are used
- Reusability opportunities
- Implementation order (dependencies)

### 5. Handoff Documentation
- How to read page specifications
- Object ID system explanation
- Content strategy references
- Testing requirements
- Quality criteria

**Workflow Reference:** [Design Delivery Workflow](../../workflows/6-design-deliveries/)

## Why This Matters

Without a Design Delivery PRD:
- Developers start coding without full context
- Implementation order is inefficient
- Design intent gets lost in translation
- "What did you mean?" meetings daily
- Specifications sit unused

With a Design Delivery PRD:
- Clear implementation roadmap
- Developers understand the full picture
- Efficient build sequence
- Specifications become actionable tasks
- Reduced rework and confusion
