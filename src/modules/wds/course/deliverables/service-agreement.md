# Deliverable: Service Agreement

**Formalize stakeholder commitment with a clear contract**

---

## About WDS & the Service Agreement

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**The Service Agreement** formalizes the commitment you secured with your Project Pitch. It protects both parties, defines clear scope, and establishes the foundation for a healthy working relationship.

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Service Agreement is your formal contract that:
- Defines scope of work (what's included, what's not)
- Establishes clear deliverables and timeline
- Protects both parties with terms and conditions
- Provides legal foundation for the project

**Created by:** Saga the Analyst  
**When:** Phase 1 (Module 03) - After pitch is accepted, before work begins  
**Format:** Markdown document converted to contract/PDF format

## Why This Matters

**Without a formal agreement:**
- ❌ Scope creep becomes unmanageable
- ❌ Payment becomes contentious ("that's not what I meant")
- ❌ No protection if client stops paying
- ❌ Unclear who owns the final work

**With a service agreement:**
- ✅ Protected scope and budget
- ✅ Clear payment terms
- ✅ Legal recourse if needed
- ✅ Professional credibility
- ✅ Foundation for healthy client relationships

---

## What's Included

- **Scope of Work:** What's included (and what's explicitly not)
- **Deliverables:** Tangible outputs you'll produce (with links to examples)
- **Timeline:** Key milestones and completion dates
- **Payment Terms:** Cost structure, payment schedule, late fees
- **Change Management:** How scope changes are handled (change order process)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** When work is considered complete
- **Intellectual Property:** Who owns what (code, designs, content)
- **Termination Clause:** How either party can exit the agreement
- **Warranties & Limitations:** What you guarantee (and don't)

## The Dialog with Your Thinking Partner: Saga the Analyst

**The Process (30-45 minutes):**

Saga the Analyst helps you formalize the agreement:

```
Saga the Analyst: "Let's protect this project with a solid agreement. 
                   What exactly is in scope?"

You: "Landing page redesign, mobile responsive, 5 pages total."

Saga the Analyst: "Good. What's explicitly OUT of scope?"

You: "No backend work, no e-commerce, no third-party integrations."

Saga the Analyst: "Perfect - that clarity prevents scope creep. 
                   Now, what are your deliverables?"

You: "Page specifications, design system, WordPress-ready content, 
      interactive prototype."

Saga the Analyst: "Great! What's your timeline and payment structure?"
```

As you talk, Saga the Analyst creates:
- ✅ Clear scope boundaries
- ✅ Specific deliverables list
- ✅ Milestone timeline
- ✅ Payment terms
- ✅ Change order process
- ✅ IP ownership terms

Then you review together:

```
Saga the Analyst: "Here's your Service Agreement. Does this protect you?"

You: "Add a 50% deposit requirement before work starts."

Saga the Analyst: "Added to payment terms. ✅ Agreement is ready."
```

**Result:** Service Agreement ready for client signature
