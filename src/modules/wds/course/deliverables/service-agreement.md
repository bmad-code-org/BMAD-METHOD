# Deliverable: Service Agreement

**Formalize stakeholder commitment with a clear contract**

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Service Agreement is your formal contract that:
- Defines scope of work (what's included, what's not)
- Establishes clear deliverables and timeline
- Protects both parties with terms and conditions
- Provides legal foundation for the project

**Created by:** Saga the WDS Analyst Agent  
**When:** Phase 1 (Module 03) - After pitch is accepted, before work begins  
**Format:** Markdown document converted to contract/PDF format

## What's Included

- **Scope of Work:** What's included (and what's explicitly not)
- **Deliverables:** Tangible outputs you'll produce (with links to examples)
- **Timeline:** Key milestones and completion dates
- **Payment Terms:** Cost structure, payment schedule, late fees
- **Change Management:** How scope changes are handled (change order process)
- **Acceptance Criteria:** When work is considered complete
- **Intellectual Property:** Who owns what (code, designs, content)
- **Termination Clause:** How either party can exit the agreement
- **Warranties & Limitations:** What you guarantee (and don't)

## Why This Matters

Without a formal agreement:
- Scope creep becomes unmanageable
- Payment becomes contentious ("that's not what I meant")
- No protection if client stops paying
- Unclear who owns the final work

With a service agreement:
- Protected scope and budget
- Clear payment terms
- Legal recourse if needed
- Professional credibility
- Foundation for healthy client relationships
