# Deliverable: Project Pitch

**Persuade stakeholders your project is worth the investment**

## About WDS & the Project Pitch

**WDS (Whiteport Design Studio)** is an AI agent framework module within the BMAD Method that transforms how designers work. Instead of creating documentation that gets lost in translation, your design work becomes **powerful prompts** that guide AI agents and development teams with precision and intent.

**The Project Pitch** is where it all begins. Before any design work starts, you need stakeholder buy-in. This deliverable helps you articulate your vision in business language that decision-makers understand, demonstrating clear ROI and strategic value.

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Project Pitch is your persuasive document that:
- Articulates your project vision in business language stakeholders understand
- Demonstrates clear ROI and strategic value
- Shows you've thought through the approach
- Convinces decision-makers to say "yes"

**Created by:** Saga the Analyst  
**When:** Phase 1 (Module 03) - Before you have formal commitment  
**Format:** Markdown document, often converted to PDF/presentation

## Why This Matters

**Without a compelling pitch:**
- ❌ Decision-makers don't understand the value
- ❌ Projects get stuck in "let me think about it" limbo
- ❌ You can't articulate ROI clearly
- ❌ Stakeholders dismiss it as "nice to have"

**With a strong pitch:**
- ✅ Clear business case for investment
- ✅ Stakeholders excited about the vision
- ✅ Decision happens quickly (yes or no)
- ✅ Foundation for alignment on goals

---

## What's Included

- **Project Overview:** Clear statement of what you're building and why
- **Business Value:** ROI, cost savings, or strategic benefits
- **Problem Statement:** What pain points does this solve?
- **Approach:** High-level methodology and timeline
- **Investment Required:** Budget, resources, time commitment
- **Success Criteria:** How we'll know if it worked
- **Next Steps:** What happens if they say yes

## The Dialog with Your Thinking Partner: Saga the Analyst

**The Process (30-45 minutes):**

Saga the Analyst helps you craft a compelling pitch:

```
Saga the Analyst: "Let's build your pitch. What's the core problem you're solving?"

You: "Our sales team wastes 10 hours a week on manual reporting."

Saga the Analyst: "Excellent. So if we automate that, what's the ROI?"

You: "10 hours × 5 reps × $50/hour × 52 weeks = $130K/year saved."

Saga the Analyst: "Perfect! That's your business value. Now, what's the vision 
                   beyond cost savings?"

You: "Sales reps focus on selling, not spreadsheets. Happier team, 
      better results."

Saga the Analyst: "Beautiful. Let me capture that..."
```

As you talk, Saga the Analyst creates:
- ✅ Clear problem statement
- ✅ Quantified business value
- ✅ Compelling vision
- ✅ Investment breakdown
- ✅ Success metrics

Then you review together:

```
Saga the Analyst: "Here's your pitch. Does this sell the vision?"

You: "Yes! But add that competitors are ahead of us on automation."

Saga the Analyst: "Added to competitive context. ✅ Pitch is ready."
```

**Result:** Project Pitch saved and ready for stakeholder presentation
