# Deliverable: Project Pitch

**Persuade stakeholders your project is worth the investment**

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Project Pitch is your persuasive document that:
- Articulates your project vision in business language stakeholders understand
- Demonstrates clear ROI and strategic value
- Shows you've thought through the approach
- Convinces decision-makers to say "yes"

**Created by:** Saga the WDS Analyst Agent  
**When:** Phase 1 (Module 03) - Before you have formal commitment  
**Format:** Markdown document, often converted to PDF/presentation

---

## What's Included

- **Project Overview:** Clear statement of what you're building and why
- **Business Value:** ROI, cost savings, or strategic benefits
- **Problem Statement:** What pain points does this solve?
- **Approach:** High-level methodology and timeline
- **Investment Required:** Budget, resources, time commitment
- **Success Criteria:** How we'll know if it worked
- **Next Steps:** What happens if they say yes

## How to Create This

**Hands-on Tutorial:** [Module 03: Alignment & Signoff](../module-03-alignment-signoff/tutorial-03.md)

**Workflow Reference:** [Alignment & Signoff Workflow](../../workflows/1-project-brief/alignment-signoff/)

## Why This Matters

Without a compelling pitch:
- Decision-makers don't understand the value
- Projects get stuck in "let me think about it" limbo
- You can't articulate ROI clearly
- Stakeholders dismiss it as "nice to have"

With a strong pitch:
- Clear business case for investment
- Stakeholders excited about the vision
- Decision happens quickly (yes or no)
- Foundation for alignment on goals
