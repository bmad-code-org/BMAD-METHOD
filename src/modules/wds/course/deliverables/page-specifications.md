# Deliverable 05: Page Specifications & Prototypes

**Turn sketches into complete specs - capture WHAT it looks like AND WHY you designed it that way**

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

Page Specifications are detailed documentation for each page/screen in your product:
- Complete content with language tags
- Component descriptions with Object IDs
- Navigation and user flows
- Strategic rationale for design decisions
- Interactive prototypes (optional)

**Created by:** Freyja the WDS UX Designer Agent  
**When:** Phase 5 - After Platform PRD (or in parallel)  
**Format:** Markdown specifications + sketches/prototypes

**Additional Tutorial:** [Module 12: Conceptual Specs](../module-12-conceptual-specs/tutorial-12.md)

**Workflow Reference:** [UX Design Workflow](../../workflows/4-ux-design/)

**Quality Workflow:** [Page Specification Quality](../../workflows/4-ux-design/page-specification-quality/)

## Why This Matters

Without Detailed Specifications:
- Developers guess at your intent
- Content gets "lorem ipsum" treatment
- Design decisions lost in handoff
- Endless "what did you mean?" meetings

With Page Specifications:
- Preserves design intent from concept to code
- Developers understand the WHY, not just the WHAT
- Content is strategic, not placeholder
- Specifications become AI-ready super-prompts
- Reduces implementation errors and rework
