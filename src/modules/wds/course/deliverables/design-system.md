# Deliverable 06: Component Library & Design Tokens

**Extract reusable patterns - scale your design efficiently across the entire product**

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Design System documents all reusable components, patterns, and design tokens:
- Component specifications (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
- Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
- Interaction patterns
- Accessibility guidelines
- Component usage rules

**Created by:** Freyja the WDS UX Designer Agent (extraction from page specs)  
**When:** Phase 6 - After initial page specifications are complete  
**Format:** Structured component library documentation

### 2. Component Library
For each component:
- Component name and Object ID pattern

- States (default, hover, active, disabled, error, loading)
- Content structure
- Usage guidelines
- Accessibility requirements
- Code examples (if applicable)

### 3. Patterns

## Why This Matters

Without a Design System:
- Every page/screen designed from scratch
- Inconsistent UI across product
- Developers reinvent components repeatedly
- No single source of truth
- Design debt accumulates fast

With a Design System:
- Rapid design and development
- Consistent user experience
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Onboarding new designers/developers faster
- Scalable design operations
