# Deliverable 03: Trigger Map & Personas

**Connect business goals to user psychology - design with insight, not guesswork**

---

## What Is This Deliverable?

The Trigger Map is a strategic framework that connects:
- **Business Goals:** What the company wants to achieve
- **User Psychology:** What motivates and frustrates your users
- **Personas:** Detailed profiles of key user groups
- **Feature Priorities:** Which features move the needle on both

**Created by:** Cascade the WDS Strategist Agent  
**When:** Phase 3 - After Product Brief, before design begins  
**Format:** Visual map + detailed persona documents

## What's Included

### 1. Business Goals

### 2. Driving Forces

- Emotional and practical triggers for each persona

### 3. Personas
Detailed profiles for each key user group:
- Background & context
- Current situation & pain points
- Goals & aspirations
- Fears & frustrations
- Motivations & values
- Tech savviness & preferences

### 4. Feature Impact Analysis

## Why This Matters

Without Trigger Mapping:
- You guess at user needs based on assumptions
- Features get prioritized by "coolness" not impact
- Design feels generic and disconnected
- No psychological foundation for UX decisions

With Trigger Mapping:
- Design decisions grounded in user psychology
- Clear feature prioritization based on impact
- Personas with depth (not demographic stereotypes)
- Connection between what users need and what business wants
