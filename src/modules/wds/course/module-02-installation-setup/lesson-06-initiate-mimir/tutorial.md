## What Mimir Will Do

Mimir will:

1. **Welcome you warmly** 🌊
2. **Assess your situation:**
   - Technical skill level (beginner → experienced)
   - Emotional state (excited, nervous, ready)
   - Familiarity with WDS
3. **Check your environment:**
   - Is WDS repository present?
   - Is your project set up correctly?
   - Do you have the docs structure?
4. **Understand your project:**
   - What are you building?
   - What phase are you in?
   - Do you need to start from Project Brief?
5. **Guide your next steps:**
   - Route you to appropriate agent if needed
   - Suggest which workflow to start with
   - Offer training if you want to learn first

## Be Honest with Mimir

**Mimir adapts to YOU.**

If you're nervous → Mimir will be extra patient  
If you're experienced → Mimir will be concise  
If you're confused → Mimir will slow down

**There are no wrong answers!**

---

## Example First Conversation

**You:**
> Hello Mimir! I just completed setup and I'm ready to start.

**Mimir:**
> Welcome! 🌊 I'm Mimir, your guide through Whiteport Design Studio.
>
> I can see you've completed the installation - that's fantastic work!
>
> Let me understand your situation:
> 1. How comfortable are you with design tools and AI assistants? (Complete beginner / Learning / Comfortable / Experienced)
> 2. What project are you working on?
> 3. How are you feeling about starting this journey?

**Just answer honestly!** Mimir will adapt to your needs.

## Alternative: Type Instead of Drag

**If dragging doesn't work:**

In the AI chat, type:

```
@MIMIR-WDS-ORCHESTRATOR.md

Hello Mimir! I just completed the installation setup and I'm ready to start.
```

This references the file and sends your message.

---

## What Happens Next?

**After your conversation with Mimir, you'll either:**

1. **Start WDS Training** - If you want to learn methodology first
2. **Begin Project Brief** - If you're ready to dive into your project
3. **Meet Specialist Agents** - Freyja (UX), Saga (Analyst), or Idunn (PM)

**Mimir will guide you to the right path based on your situation.**

---

## Whenever You Need Help

**Remember this simple command:**

```
@wds-mimir [your question]
```

**Examples:**
- `@wds-mimir I'm stuck on trigger mapping, can you help?`
- `@wds-mimir Which agent should I work with for UX design?`
- `@wds-mimir I feel overwhelmed, where should I start?`
- `@wds-mimir Can you walk me through the WDS training?`

**No question is too small. Mimir is always here to guide you.**

---

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Can't find MIMIR file  
**Solution:** Make sure you added `whiteport-design-studio` to workspace (Lesson 05, Step 5)

**Issue:** Drag doesn't work  
**Solution:** Use `@MIMIR-WDS-ORCHESTRATOR.md` instead

**Issue:** AI doesn't respond  
**Solution:** Make sure you're connected to internet, wait a moment, try again

**Issue:** Not sure what to say  
**Solution:** Just say "Hello! I'm new and ready to start" - Mimir will guide you from there
