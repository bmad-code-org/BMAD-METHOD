# Lesson 01: Create Your GitHub Account

**Get your professional GitHub account set up**

---

## What You'll Do

- Create GitHub account
- Choose professional username
- Verify your email
- Log in successfully

**Time:** 5-10 minutes

## What is GitHub?

Think of GitHub as:
- **Professional cloud storage** for your project files
- **Time machine** - every change saved, can go back to any version
- **Collaboration tool** - work with others seamlessly

**For designers:** GitHub is where your WDS specifications will live, backed up and version-controlled.

## Step 1: Sign Up

1. Go to **https://github.com**
2. Click the green **"Sign up"** button (top right)
3. Enter your email address
4. Create a password (make it strong!)
5. Choose a username

## Choosing Your Username

**Username Tips:**

✅ **Professional** - You might share this with clients  
✅ **Simple** - Easy to remember and spell  
✅ **Memorable** - Represents you or your work

**Good Examples:**
- `john-designer`
- `sarahux`
- `mike-creates`
- `[yourname]-design`

**Avoid:**
- `xXcooldesigner420Xx` (not professional)
- `temporary12345` (not memorable)
- Very long complicated names

7. Check your email inbox
8. Click the verification link from GitHub

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Didn't receive verification email  
**Solution:** Check spam folder, or click "Resend verification email"

**Issue:** Username already taken  
**Solution:** Try variations with hyphens or numbers (`john-ux-designer`, `sarah-designs-2`)
