# Lesson 02: Git Configuration

**Let your IDE handle Git automatically**

---

## What You'll Do

- Understand what Git does
- Let Cursor install Git automatically
- OR use GitHub Desktop (visual alternative)

**Time:** 5 minutes

---

## What is Git?

**Git** syncs your computer with GitHub. Good news: You don't need to install it manually!

---

## Option 1: Let Cursor Handle It (Recommended)

**Do nothing now!**

When you clone in Lesson 03, Cursor will:
1. Check if Git is installed
2. Prompt "Install Git?" if needed
3. You click "Install"
4. Done!

**This is easiest for beginners.**

---

## Option 2: GitHub Desktop (Visual Alternative)

**For designers who prefer visual tools:**

### Why GitHub Desktop?

- No terminal commands
- Visual interface
- See changes graphically
- Many professionals use it

### Install

1. Download: https://desktop.github.com
2. Install (standard installer)
3. Sign in with GitHub account
4. Use it to clone repositories (Lesson 03)
5. Use Cursor to edit specifications

**This is a valid professional workflow!**

## Recap: Your Repository Structure

**You decided in Lesson 01:**

**Single repo (`my-project`):**
```
my-project/
├── docs/    ← Specs
└── src/     ← Code
```

**Separate repo (`my-project-specs`):**
```
my-project-specs/    ← Specs only
```

## What's Next?

Git will be ready when you need it! Now clone your repository and add WDS.
