## Comments to Monitor & Respond To

**Expected viewer questions:**

1. **"What if my client refuses to sign a contract?"**
   - Response: "That's a red flag. Professional clients expect contracts - they protect both parties. If they refuse, reconsider if you want to work with them. No contract = no project."

2. **"How do I price my work?"**
   - Response: "Three approaches: 1) Fixed-price based on deliverables 2) Hourly/daily rate based on time 3) Value-based on impact. Calculate your costs + desired profit. Justify with ROI. The tutorial walks through this!"

3. **"What if they ask for changes mid-project?"**
   - Response: "That's when you use change orders. 'That's outside our current scope. I can provide a change order with the additional cost and timeline impact.' It's professional, not defensive."

4. **"I'm too junior to ask for contracts."**
   - Response: "Being junior doesn't mean you work without protection. Professional clients respect contracts regardless of your experience level. Start building these habits now."

5. **"What if I'm just doing a small project?"**
   - Response: "Small projects still need scope clarity. Use a simplified version - 1-page agreement with scope, deliverables, timeline, payment. Protect yourself."
