# Step 0: Create Project Pitch

## Purpose

Establish the foundational case for why this project matters and should be built before diving into detailed strategic planning.

## Context for Agent

You are helping the user create a compelling pitch that makes the case for the project's existence. This pitch serves as the foundation that justifies investing time and resources into the project brief and subsequent design work. Think of this as the "elevator pitch" or "business case" that answers: "Why should we build this?"

## Key Elements

This step establishes the strategic justification for the project by exploring:

- **Problem/Opportunity** - What problem are we solving or opportunity are we capturing?
- **Why Now?** - What makes this the right time to pursue this?
- **Proposed Solution** - High-level approach (detailed solution comes later)
- **Why This Will Work** - Credibility, feasibility, unique advantages
- **Expected Impact** - What outcomes will this create?
- **Investment Required** - What resources are needed?
- **Call to Action** - Decision point to proceed

## Instructions

1. **Introduce the pitch concept**
   - Explain that before we dive into detailed strategic planning, we need to establish why this project matters
   - Frame this as creating the "business case" or "elevator pitch" for the project
   - Set expectation: This will be used to justify the project and guide decision-making

2. **Explore the Problem/Opportunity**
   - "What problem are we solving, or what opportunity are we capturing?"
   - "Who is experiencing this problem or missing this opportunity?"
   - "What happens if we don't address this?"
   - Listen for: Pain points, market gaps, unmet needs, emerging trends

3. **Understand Why Now**
   - "What makes this the right time to pursue this project?"
   - "What has changed that makes this urgent or timely?"
   - Listen for: Market shifts, technology readiness, competitive threats, timing factors

4. **Capture Proposed Solution (High-Level)**
   - "At a high level, what kind of solution are we proposing?"
   - "What's the general approach we're taking?"
   - Keep this high-level - detailed solution design comes later
   - Listen for: Solution type, general approach, key capabilities

5. **Explore Why This Will Work**
   - "What gives us confidence this will succeed?"
   - "What unique advantages or capabilities do we have?"
   - "What makes us the right team/approach for this?"
   - Listen for: Unique assets, expertise, market position, competitive advantages

6. **Define Expected Impact**
   - "What outcomes are we expecting from this project?"
   - "How will we measure success?"
   - "What changes will this create?"
   - Listen for: Business outcomes, user benefits, market impact, metrics

7. **Clarify Investment Required**
   - "What resources will this project require?"
   - "What's the scope of investment we're considering?"
   - Keep this at a high level - detailed planning comes later
   - Listen for: Time, budget, team, technology, dependencies

8. **Crystallize the Pitch**
   - Synthesize all elements into a cohesive pitch statement
   - Help craft a compelling narrative that ties everything together
   - Use collaborative language: "What I'm hearing is..." or "It sounds like..."
   - Ask: "Does this capture why this project matters and should be built?"

## Pitch Framework (Optional Guide)

If user needs structure, you can offer this framework:

```
**The Problem/Opportunity:**
[What we're addressing]

**Why Now:**
[What makes this timely]

**Our Proposed Solution:**
[High-level approach]

**Why This Will Work:**
[Our unique advantages]

**Expected Impact:**
[Outcomes we'll create]

**Investment Required:**
[Resources needed]

**Decision Point:**
[Why we should proceed]
```

## Next Step

After capturing the pitch, proceed to step-01-init.md to begin the detailed Project Brief workflow.

## State Update

Update frontmatter of output file:

```yaml
stepsCompleted: ['step-00-pitch.md']
pitch:
  problem_opportunity: '[captured problem/opportunity]'
  why_now: '[captured timing rationale]'
  proposed_solution: '[high-level solution approach]'
  why_this_will_work: '[credibility/feasibility factors]'
  expected_impact: '[expected outcomes]'
  investment_required: '[resources needed]'
  pitch_statement: '[synthesized pitch narrative]'
```
