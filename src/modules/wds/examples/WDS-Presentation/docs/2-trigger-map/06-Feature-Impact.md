## Feature Details & Rationale

### Must Have MVP (Primary High OR Top Tier Score)

#### 1. BMad Method Integration (Score: 11) 🏆
**Seamless handoff from design to development phases**

- **Stina Impact (HIGH):** Enables "make real impact" - her designs actually get built properly
- **Lars Impact (HIGH):** Smooth workflow = team productivity + quality delivery
- **Felix Impact (HIGH):** Structured handoff = clear specs = enlightened day

**Why This Matters:** All three personas benefit. This is the bridge that makes WDS complete - designers create, developers implement smoothly. Without this, value proposition breaks down.

---

#### 2. Complete End-to-End Workflow (Score: 9)
**Full methodology covering all phases from vision to handoff**

- **Stina Impact (HIGH):** Addresses "being strategic expert" want - she owns the complete journey
- **Lars Impact (HIGH):** Ensures quality throughout entire process, no gaps
- **Felix Impact (MEDIUM):** Better handoff means fewer headaches

**Why This Matters:** Core differentiation from fragmented tools. Shows WDS isn't just another prototyping tool - it's a complete professional methodology.

---

#### 3. Why-Based Specifications (Score: 9)
**Specifications that explain WHAT + WHY + WHAT NOT TO DO**

- **Stina Impact (HIGH):** Makes her indispensable - her thinking is preserved
- **Lars Impact (MEDIUM):** Better quality, less confusion in execution
- **Felix Impact (HIGH):** Directly addresses his "clear specs" want - major pain point solved

**Why This Matters:** This is the secret sauce. Felix's happiness depends on this. Stina becomes irreplaceable because AI can't replicate her "why." Lars gets quality.

---

#### 4. Example Projects & Case Studies (Score: 8)
**Real-world examples showing WDS in action (Dog Week: 5x faster)**

- **Stina Impact (HIGH):** Addresses "wasting time" fear - proof it works before investing effort
- **Lars Impact (HIGH):** Validates methodology before committing his team
- **Felix Impact (LOW):** Nice to see, but doesn't directly help him

**Why This Matters:** Trust builder. Stina and Lars both need proof before adopting. Dog Week case study (26 weeks → 5 weeks) is compelling evidence.

---

#### 5. Testimonials & Social Proof (Score: 8)
**Real designer and client testimonials showing WDS impact**

- **Stina Impact (HIGH):** Addresses "wasting time" fear - peer validation from other designers who succeeded
- **Lars Impact (HIGH):** Social proof from other entrepreneurs validates investment decision
- **Felix Impact (LOW):** Doesn't care about marketing; cares about actual specs quality

**Why This Matters:** Peer validation is different from case studies. While case studies provide detailed proof, testimonials give quick emotional reassurance. "People like me succeeded with this" is powerful for both Stina (designer peers) and Lars (business peers). This complements Example Projects - case studies prove methodology works, testimonials prove it's worth the effort.

---

#### 6. Course Modules (Score: 6)
**Educational content teaching WDS step-by-step with video + lessons**

- **Stina Impact (HIGH):** Addresses "wasting time" fear + builds AI confidence through hand-holding
- **Lars Impact (MEDIUM):** Helps him understand what his designer will use
- **Felix Impact (LOW):** Not his primary concern

**Why This Matters:** Critical for Stina's transformation. Without structured learning, she won't gain confidence. The hand-holding approach is essential.

---

#### 7. Installation & Setup Documentation (Score: 5)
**Clear step-by-step guide to getting WDS running**

- **Stina Impact (HIGH):** Addresses "wasting time" fear - removes barrier to entry
- **Lars Impact (LOW):** His designer's responsibility
- **Felix Impact (LOW):** Designer's setup process

**Why This Matters:** All Primary High features are Must Have. If Stina can't get started easily, she'll abandon WDS. Hand-holding is critical for adoption.

---

#### 8. WDS Agents (Score: 5)
**AI agents (Saga, Freyja, Idunn, Mimir) that guide through each phase**

- **Stina Impact (HIGH):** Core value - "AI as co-pilot" with structured guidance
- **Lars Impact (LOW):** Behind-the-scenes tool for his designer
- **Felix Impact (LOW):** Designer's workflow, not his

**Why This Matters:** All Primary High features are Must Have. The agents ARE the methodology in practice. This is how Stina experiences "shouldering complexity with excitement."

---

### Consider for MVP

#### 9. Design System Module (Score: 5)
**Structured approach to creating reusable design systems**

- **Stina Impact (MEDIUM):** Professional capability, but not core transformation
- **Lars Impact (MEDIUM):** Nice for consistency across products
- **Felix Impact (MEDIUM):** Helps with implementation consistency

**Why Consider:** Valuable for mature teams with multiple products, but not critical for Stina's initial transformation or Lars's immediate needs. Can be added post-MVP.

---

#### 10. GitHub Repository & Documentation (Score: 4)
**Open-source access to all WDS resources**

- **Stina Impact (MEDIUM):** Access is important, but content matters more
- **Lars Impact (LOW):** Not his world
- **Felix Impact (MEDIUM):** Familiar format, appreciates documentation

**Why Consider:** GitHub IS where WDS lives, so this exists by default. But prominence on the presentation page is secondary to explaining value and methodology.

---

#### 11. Community & Discord Support (Score: 3)
**Active community for questions, sharing, and collaboration**

- **Stina Impact (MEDIUM):** Support reduces risk, but not core transformation
- **Lars Impact (LOW):** His designer's resource
- **Felix Impact (LOW):** Designer community, not his focus

**Why Consider:** Valuable for retention and ongoing support, but not critical for initial adoption decision. Mention it, but don't feature prominently in MVP.

## Strategic Implications for UX Design

### **Hero Section Priority:**
Focus on **BMad Integration**, **End-to-End Workflow**, and **Why-Based Specs** - the top differentiators that serve all personas.

### **Early Content Focus:**
Lead with **Example Projects** (proof) and **Testimonials** (peer validation) to overcome Stina's "wasting time" fear and Lars's validation need. Follow with **Complete Workflow** (differentiation).

### **Course Module Prominence:**
Make **Course Modules** and **Installation** highly visible and accessible - remove all friction from Stina's learning path.

### **Agent Introduction:**
Present **WDS Agents** as the personality and guide of the methodology - make them relatable and trustworthy.

### **Secondary Features:**
Mention **Design System**, **GitHub**, and **Community** but don't feature them prominently in MVP content.

---

## Development Phase Implications

### **Phase 1 MVP:**
- BMad Method Integration messaging
- Complete workflow explanation
- Why-based specifications showcase
- Dog Week case study (prominent)
- Testimonials from early adopters (designer + entrepreneur + developer perspectives)
- Course Modules 01-02 (complete)
- Installation guide (detailed)
- Agent introductions (personality-driven)

### **Phase 2 Enhancements:**
- Design System module details
- GitHub repository prominence
- Community/Discord integration
- Additional case studies
- More course modules

---

## Key Insights

### **The Flywheel in Features:**

1. **Proof It Works** (Example Projects + Testimonials) → Stina and Lars trust WDS
2. **Easy to Start** (Installation + Course) → Stina begins learning
3. **Structured Guidance** (Agents + Workflow) → Stina gains confidence
4. **Better Specs** (Why-Based) → Felix's life improves
5. **Smooth Handoff** (BMad Integration) → Lars sees quality + productivity
6. **Success Creates Evangelists** → More testimonials → 50 hardcore believers emerge

### **Felix is the Secret Weapon:**

Why-Based Specifications (Score: 9) directly addresses Felix's main pain point. When Felix's day is "enlightened" by clear specs, he becomes an advocate. This validates Lars's investment and proves Stina's value.

**Design Implication:** Show how WDS makes developers happy - this is proof of designer value.

### **All Primary High Features Matter:**

Every feature where Stina scored HIGH (5) is Must Have MVP. Why? Because Stina IS the engine. The 50 evangelists come from successful Stinas. Without her complete transformation, the flywheel doesn't start.

## Questions for Designer (Phase 4)

When designing the page, consider:

1. **How do we make BMad Integration tangible?** (It's abstract but highest-scoring)
2. **Should Dog Week case study have its own section or integrate throughout?**
3. **Testimonials: Where and how many?** (Need designer, entrepreneur, and developer perspectives)
4. **How much personality should agents have on the page?** (Critical feature but hard to show)
5. **Installation: Prominent CTA or embedded in course section?**
6. **How do we show "end-to-end" visually?** (Diagram? Illustration?)
