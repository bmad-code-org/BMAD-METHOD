## Target Groups (Prioritized)

### 1. Stina the Strategist (Designer) - PRIMARY 🎯

**Priority Reasoning:** Designers shoulder the leadership role. They're the linchpin between business goals and technical implementation. WDS makes them indispensable by giving them the methodology to carry this burden well. These become the 50 hardcore evangelists.

> Multi-dimensional thinker who loves systems thinking, aesthetics, functionality, and human psychology. Studied psychology and cognition at university. No straight career path - arrived through passion for the meeting between business and user needs. Currently at end of 1-year contract as lone designer in dev team, actively job hunting. Overwhelmed, secretly works overtime. Uses AI in hobbies but lacks confidence to use professionally. Needs hand-holding and structured path.

**✅ Top 3 Positive Drivers:**
- To be the go-to strategic expert - valued and asked for advice
- To make real impact on the world through grand adventures
- To confidently use AI professionally and scale her impact

**⚠️ Top 3 Negative Drivers:**
- Being replaced by AI or becoming irrelevant
- Wasting time/energy on tools that don't work (banging head against wall)
- Being sidelined or not valued when she could save the world

---

### 2. Lars the Leader (Entrepreneur) - SECONDARY 💼

**Priority Reasoning:** Entrepreneurs validate that WDS delivers business value and create demand for WDS-trained designers. They need to trust designers and say "We need this, make it happen."

> Seasoned entrepreneur (employee #3, practically founder) who's burned through projects and learned there are no shortcuts. Not a tech person but plays hybrid PM/CTO role. Leans on consultants. Paid off technical debt, now optimizing UX. Designer going on maternity leave - needs stand-in with AI knowledge and drive. Values team happiness and "spark in eyes" when learning. Takes downtime and bugs very personally.

**✅ Top 3 Positive Drivers:**
- Team that's happy AND productive (optimized machinery)
- Smooth designer transition with AI-savvy replacement
- Quality work that fulfills the vision (willing to pay)

**⚠️ Top 3 Negative Drivers:**
- Quality dropping or bottlenecks (takes very personally)
- Being taken advantage of by consultants
- Being embarrassed in front of his team

---

### 3. Felix the Full-Stack (Developer) - TERTIARY 💻

**Priority Reasoning:** Developers benefit from designer's leadership through better specifications. They aren't the primary WDS audience but need to know it makes their life easier.

> Full-stack developer with straight career path. Studied software engineering, employed his whole life. Loves BMad Method structure and documentation (but hates writing it). Respects designers because he's terrible at "GUIs - who even calls it that anymore?" Loves AI technology but has love-hate relationship with AI code quality. Perfect situation: Designer does "the poetry," gives him good specs, he does his "magic" on dev side.

**✅ Top 3 Positive Drivers:**
- Clear, logical specifications that make his life easier
- Designers who think things through before handing off
- Work that enlightens his day (not creates problems)

**⚠️ Top 3 Negative Drivers:**
- Illogical designs creating cascading headaches
- Vague specs forcing him to guess designer's intent
- Being forced to do UI work he's terrible at

## The Battle Cry 🔥

**"Shoulder the complexity, break it down using AI as your co-pilot. Not as a burden, but with excitement. Not as a task, but as a calling!"**

## Design Focus Statement

**The WDS Presentation Page transforms designers from overwhelmed task-doers into empowered strategic leaders who shoulder complexity as a calling, not a burden.**

**Primary Design Target:** Stina the Strategist (Designer)

**Must Address (Critical for Conversion):**
1. Fear of AI replacing designers → Show how WDS makes designers indispensable
2. Lack of confidence with AI tools → Provide structured, hand-holding path
3. Feeling overwhelmed and sidelined → Position as strategic leader who shoulders complexity
4. Wasting time on tools that don't work → Prove methodology with real results (Dog Week case study)
5. Not being valued → Show path to becoming "go-to expert" asked for advice

**Should Address (Supporting Conversion):**
1. Lars needs trust signals → Show entrepreneurs how WDS designers deliver business value
2. Felix needs to see benefits → Quick mention that specs will be better
3. Community proof → Show the 50 evangelists emerging (testimonials, case studies)
4. Learning curve concerns → Module structure with hand-holding clear
5. Integration with dev workflow → BMad Method foundation explained

---

## Cross-Group Patterns

### Shared Drivers Across All Three

**Common Ground:**
- All three want **quality work** and **clear communication**
- All three fear **wasted effort** and **things breaking down**
- All three value **structure** and **thinking things through**
- All three are interested in **AI** but have reservations

**Design Implication:** WDS speaks to a shared desire for structure, quality, and thoughtful AI integration. The page should emphasize these universal values while primarily addressing Stina.

---

### Unique Drivers Per Group

**Stina's Unique Needs:**
- Emotional transformation: burden → calling
- Identity shift: task-doer → strategic leader
- AI confidence building with hand-holding

**Lars's Unique Needs:**
- Business validation and ROI proof
- Trust in designer-led process
- Team optimization and smooth transitions

**Felix's Unique Needs:**
- Better handoffs and fewer headaches
- UI help without learning design
- Respect for logical consistency

---

### Strategic Relationships

**The Triangle:**
```
        STINA (Designer)
        Strategic Leader
       Shoulders complexity
              │
              │ Creates specs for
              ▼
        FELIX (Developer)
        Gets logical specs
        Life gets easier
              │
              │ Delivers quality for
              ▼
         LARS (Entrepreneur)
         Gets business value
         Trusts the process
              │
              │ Hires/values
              └──────────────► STINA
                              (Loop closes)
```

**The Flywheel:**
1. Stina learns WDS → becomes strategic leader
2. Stina delivers better specs → Felix's life improves
3. Felix delivers quality → Lars's business succeeds
4. Lars hires more WDS designers → creates demand
5. Success stories inspire more Stinas → 50 evangelists emerge
6. Evangelists spread WDS → 1,000 designers adopt

**Design Implication:** The page must start the flywheel by converting Stina first. Lars and Felix are supporting actors in Stina's hero journey.
