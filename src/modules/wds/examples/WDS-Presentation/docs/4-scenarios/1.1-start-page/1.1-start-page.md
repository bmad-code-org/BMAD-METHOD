### 1.1 WDS Page

![WDS Presentation Page Desktop](sketches/1-1-start-page-desktop-concept.jpg)

# 1.1 WDS Page

The WDS Presentation page serves as the primary entry point for designers discovering WDS for the first time. This page addresses the universal pain point of feeling threatened and overwhelmed by AI while promising the emotional transformation to empowered strategic leadership. The page must convert curious visitors into engaged learners by demonstrating immediate value and removing adoption barriers.

**User Situation**: Stina the Strategist, a designer feeling overwhelmed by AI disruption, job hunting, AI-curious but lacking confidence. She's skeptical but hopeful - doesn't want to waste time on another tool. Needs quick value assessment: "Is this worth my time?"

**Page Purpose**: Convert visitors into learners/users by addressing core emotional drivers from the trigger map - eliminating overwhelm while building confidence that designers can thrive (not just survive) in the AI era through structured methodology and strategic leadership.

## Page Sections

### Hero Object
**Purpose**: Capture attention and communicate core value in 5 seconds

**Strategic Rationale:** See [Content Strategy - Hero Section](../../1-project-brief/02-content-strategy.md#hero-section) for messaging decisions and psychology.

#### Main Headline
**OBJECT ID**: `wds-hero-headline`
- **Component**: H1 heading (`.text-heading-1`)
- **Content**: "Whiteport Design Studio, WDS"
- **Behavior**: Static text
- **Style**: Bold, Current Whiteport heading font, ~48px, Color: White, Line height: 1.2
- **Rationale**: Clear, branded, professional. Not trying to be clever.

#### Battle Cry Tagline
**OBJECT ID**: `wds-hero-tagline`
- **Component**: H2 heading (`.text-heading-2`)
- **Content**: "Shoulder the complexity, break it down using AI as your co-pilot. Not as a burden, but with excitement. Not as a task, but as a calling!"
- **Behavior**: Static text
- **Style**: Same font as H1, ~28px, Medium weight, White (90% transparency), Line height: 1.4, Italic for emotional quality
- **Rationale**: Acknowledges complexity (honest), positions AI as helper (co-pilot), emotional shift: burden → calling

#### Hero Body Copy
**OBJECT ID**: `wds-hero-body`
- **Component**: Body text paragraph (`.text-body`)
- **Content**: "Free and open-source design methodology and AI agents for designers who mean business. Transform from overwhelmed task-doer into empowered strategic leader. Create specifications that become AI-ready super-prompts, preserving your design intent through to implementation. Built on 25 years of proven methodology. For designers everywhere."
- **Behavior**: Static text
- **Style**: Body font, ~18px, Regular weight, White or light gray, Line height: 1.6, Max width: 540px
- **Word Count**: ~50 words (5-7 second read)
- **Rationale**: Line 1 establishes category + audience, Line 2 shows transformation journey, Line 3 builds credibility (25 years) + accessibility

#### Primary CTA Button
**OBJECT ID**: `wds-hero-cta`
- **Component**: Button Primary Large
- **Content**: "Get WDS Now - Free on GitHub"
- **Behavior**: onClick → Navigate to `https://github.com/whiteport/wds`

  - Hover: Darken/shift hue, Scale 1.05, Increase shadow depth, 200ms transition
  - Active: Scale 0.98, Reduce shadow
  - Focus: 2px blue outline ring
- **Rationale**: Action-oriented ("Get" not "Learn More"), transparency ("Free on GitHub"), single CTA reduces decision paralysis

**OBJECT ID**: `wds-hero-illustration`
- **Component**: Hero image/illustration
- **Content**: Designer working with specifications/tablet visual
- **Behavior**: Static display (optional: subtle animation on designer working)
