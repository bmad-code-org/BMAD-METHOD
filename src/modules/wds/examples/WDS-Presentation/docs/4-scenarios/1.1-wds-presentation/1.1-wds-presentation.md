![WDS Presentation Page Desktop](sketches/1-1-wds-presentation-desktop-concept.jpg)

# 1.1 WDS Presentation

The WDS Presentation page serves as the primary entry point for designers discovering WDS for the first time. This page addresses the universal pain point of feeling threatened and overwhelmed by AI while promising the emotional transformation to empowered strategic leadership. The page must convert curious visitors into engaged learners by demonstrating immediate value and removing adoption barriers.

**User Situation**: Stina the Strategist, a designer feeling overwhelmed by AI disruption, job hunting, AI-curious but lacking confidence. She's skeptical but hopeful - doesn't want to waste time on another tool. Needs quick value assessment: "Is this worth my time?"

**Page Purpose**: Convert visitors into learners/users by addressing core emotional drivers from the trigger map - eliminating overwhelm while building confidence that designers can thrive (not just survive) in the AI era through structured methodology and strategic leadership.
