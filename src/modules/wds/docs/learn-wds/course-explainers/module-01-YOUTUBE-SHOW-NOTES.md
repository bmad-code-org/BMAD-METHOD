**Title:**  
Module 01: Why WDS Matters - Are You a Factory Worker or a Linchpin Designer?

---

## Description

The AI era is here. The question isn't whether AI will change design - it already has. The question is: are you a factory worker or a linchpin designer? Replaceable or indispensable?

In this 30-minute deep dive, we explore why designers are irreplaceable in the AI era - not because of tools or aesthetic taste, but because of emotional labor, user-centric creativity, and the ability to walk into chaos and create order.

You'll learn:
✅ Seth Godin's Linchpin concept and why it matters for designers RIGHT NOW
✅ The three irreplaceable gifts only human designers can provide
✅ 5-dimensional thinking - the practical skill that makes you indispensable
✅ The three-part transformation WDS guides you through
✅ How to stop hiding and start acting: I Can. I Do. I Will.

This isn't about learning new tools. This is about choosing who you are as a designer.
