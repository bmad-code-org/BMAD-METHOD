## Description

"I've never used GitHub. I've never installed an IDE. I'm worried I'll mess something up."

Sound familiar? You're not alone. Every designer was once exactly where you are now.

In this 30-minute guided walkthrough, we take you from complete beginner to fully set up with Whiteport Design Studio - even if you've never touched GitHub, Git, or an IDE before.

You'll learn:
✅ How to create a GitHub account and repository (it's easier than you think!)
✅ Installing your IDE workspace (Cursor or VS Code)
✅ Cloning your project to your computer
✅ Adding WDS to your workspace
✅ Meeting Mimir - your personal WDS guide

This isn't about becoming technical. This is about getting your professional environment set up so you can focus on what matters: designing with confidence.

**Total setup time:** 45-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites:** Computer + Internet + Email  
**Technical experience required:** None

## Repository Structure Decision

**Single Repository** (`my-project`)
- Specs + code together
- Use when: Small team, building yourself, simple communication

**Separate Specifications Repository** (`my-project-specs`)
- Specs only, separate code repo
- Use when: Corporate, many developers, clear handoff needed

**Name your repository based on your choice!**

## The Docs Structure

Your 8-phase WDS methodology folders:

📁 **1-project-brief** - Vision and strategy  
📁 **2-trigger-mapping** - User psychology and decisions  
📁 **3-prd-platform** - Product requirements  
📁 **4-ux-design** - User experience design  
📁 **5-design-system** - Visual language and components

## Common Questions

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**  
A: No! You're setting up a workspace, not learning to code.

**Q: What if I make a mistake?**  
A: GitHub is your time machine - you can always go back. And Mimir is always available to help.

**Q: Do I need to manually install Git?**  
A: Nope! Modern IDEs auto-install Git when you need it.

**Q: Can I use VS Code instead of Cursor?**  
A: Absolutely! Both work great. Cursor is optimized for AI work, but VS Code is excellent too.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**  
A: Type `@wds-mimir [your question]` in your AI chat. He's always there to help.

**Q: Single repo or separate specs repo?**  
A: Most beginners should use single repo. It's simpler and you can always split later.
