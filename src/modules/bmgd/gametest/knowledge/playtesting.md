# Playtesting Fundamentals

## Overview

Playtesting is the process of having people play your game to gather feedback and identify issues. It's distinct from QA testing in that it focuses on player experience, fun factor, and design validation rather than bug hunting.

## Types of Playtesting

### Internal Playtesting

- **Developer Testing** - Daily testing during development
- **Team Testing** - Cross-discipline team plays together
- **Best for:** Rapid iteration, catching obvious issues

### External Playtesting

- **Friends & Family** - Trusted external testers
- **Focus Groups** - Targeted demographic testing
- **Public Beta** - Large-scale community testing
- **Best for:** Fresh perspectives, UX validation

### Specialized Playtesting

- **Accessibility Testing** - Players with disabilities
- **Localization Testing** - Regional/cultural validation
- **Competitive Testing** - Balance and meta testing

## Playtesting Process

### 1. Define Goals

Before each playtest session, define:

- What questions are you trying to answer?
- What features are you testing?
- What metrics will you gather?

### 2. Prepare the Build

- Create a stable, playable build
- Include telemetry/logging if needed
- Prepare any necessary documentation

### 3. Brief Testers

- Explain what to test (or don't, for blind testing)
- Set expectations for bugs/polish level
- Provide feedback mechanisms

### 4. Observe and Record

- Watch players without intervening
- Note confusion points, frustration, delight
- Record gameplay if possible

### 5. Gather Feedback

- Structured surveys for quantitative data
- Open discussion for qualitative insights
- Allow time for "what else?" comments

### 6. Analyze and Act

- Identify patterns across testers
- Prioritize issues by frequency and severity
- Create actionable tasks from findings

## Key Metrics to Track

### Engagement Metrics

- Session length
- Return rate
- Completion rate
- Drop-off points

### Difficulty Metrics

- Deaths/failures per section
- Time to complete sections
- Hint/help usage
- Difficulty setting distribution

### UX Metrics

- Time to first action
- Tutorial completion rate
- Menu navigation patterns
- Control scheme preferences

## Common Playtesting Pitfalls

### Leading Questions

**Bad:** "Did you find the combat exciting?"
**Good:** "How would you describe the combat?"

### Intervening Too Soon

Let players struggle before helping. Confusion is valuable data.

### Testing Too Late

Start playtesting early with paper prototypes and gray boxes.

### Ignoring Negative Feedback

Negative feedback is often the most valuable. Don't dismiss it.

### Over-Relying on Verbal Feedback

Watch what players DO, not just what they SAY. Actions reveal truth.
