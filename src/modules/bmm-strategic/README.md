## Best Practices

### 3. Data-Driven Decisions
Use Growth Engineer to quantify impact before making major product decisions.

### 4. User-Centric Design
Engage UX Strategist early in feature planning, not just for polish.

### 5. Market Awareness
Regularly update competitive intelligence via Market Strategist.

## Integration with Distributed Teams

For teams using SMTP/Git communication with remote contractors:

1. Strategic decisions flow down as prioritized work items
2. Compliance requirements become story acceptance criteria
3. UX requirements inform design specs
4. Growth metrics define success criteria

```
Strategic Layer (you)
    │
    ├── Vision & Priorities
    ├── Compliance Requirements
    ├── UX Guidelines
    └── Success Metrics
    │
    ▼ (via SMTP/Git)

Execution Layer (contractors)
    │
    ├── Receive: Story specs with strategic context
    ├── Deliver: Code via Git PRs
    └── Report: Status via SMTP
```
