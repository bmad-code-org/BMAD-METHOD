# Analyze Text Workflow

## Purpose
Perform deep literary analysis on uploaded texts to extract techniques, patterns, and insights that can be applied to your own writing.

## When to Use
- Studying a published novel you admire
- Analyzing a bestseller in your genre
- Learning from a particular author's style
- Understanding why a book works (or doesn't)
- Building your technique library
- Comparing your draft to published work

## Prerequisites
- Text file to analyze (.txt, .md, .docx, or .pdf)
- At least 1,000 words (ideally a full chapter or more)

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Upload Text
You'll be prompted to upload the text file you want analyzed.

**Supported formats:**
- Plain text (.txt)
- Markdown (.md)
- Word documents (.docx)
- PDF (text-based, not scanned images)

**Optimal length:**
- Single chapter: 2,000-5,000 words
- Multiple chapters: 10,000-25,000 words
- Full novel: Any length (analysis will focus on key sections)

### Step 2: Select Analysis Type
Choose the depth and focus of analysis:

#### Full Analysis (15-20 minutes)
Complete analysis across all dimensions:
- Structural breakdown
- Character analysis
- Prose metrics
- Technique extraction
- Genre comparison

**Best for:** Learning comprehensively from a text

#### Structural Only (8-10 minutes)
Focus on:
- Plot points and act structure
- Pacing analysis
- Chapter organization
- Scene sequencing

**Best for:** Understanding story architecture

#### Character Focus (8-10 minutes)
Focus on:
- Character arcs
- Characterization techniques
- Dialogue and voice
- Relationship dynamics

**Best for:** Learning character development

#### Prose Analysis (8-10 minutes)
Focus on:
- Sentence structure and variety
- Word choice patterns
- Figurative language
- Rhythm and flow
- Show vs tell balance

**Best for:** Improving prose craft

#### Quick Overview (5 minutes)
High-level assessment:
- Genre identification
- Major strengths
- Key techniques worth studying
- Overall impressions

**Best for:** Deciding if you want full analysis later

### Step 3: Perform Analysis
The Librarian will analyze the text according to your chosen type, following the systematic protocol in the instructions document.

**What happens:**
- Text is read and annotated
- Patterns are identified
- Examples are quoted
- Metrics are calculated
- Comparisons are made to genre conventions

### Step 4: Extract Techniques
Specific techniques are identified and documented:
- What the technique is
- How it's used in this text
- Why it works
- When to use it
- How to apply it to your work

### Step 5: Generate Recommendations
You'll receive:
- **Top learnings**: 3-5 key takeaways
- **Application suggestions**: How to use these in your novel
- **Practice exercises**: Ways to develop these skills
- **Further study**: Related techniques to explore

### Step 6: Save Results
The complete analysis is saved to:
`_bmad/_memory/librarian-sidecar/knowledge/analyzed-texts/{title}-analysis.md`

Extracted techniques are also cataloged in the technique patterns library for future reference.

### Step 7: Next Steps
You'll be offered options:
1. **Apply to your novel**: Use these techniques in your current project
2. **Compare texts**: Analyze another text and compare approaches
3. **Generate exercises**: Practice the techniques you learned
4. **Deep dive**: Explore a specific technique in more detail
5. **Archive**: Simply save for future reference

## Output Examples

### Structural Analysis Output
```
## Plot Structure Analysis

**Inciting Incident** (12%, p. 23)
Protagonist discovers the letter that changes everything.
*Technique*: Delayed inciting incident allows character establishment first.

**First Plot Point** (27%, p. 51)
Decision to investigate despite warnings.
*Technique*: Active choice by protagonist (agency, not passive reaction).

**Midpoint** (48%, p. 97)
False victory - thinks mystery is solved, but discovers deeper conspiracy.
*Technique*: Midpoint reversal that raises stakes and changes direction.

**All Is Lost** (76%, p. 152)
Ally betrayal + evidence destroyed + deadline missed.
*Technique*: Triple-layered disaster for maximum impact.

**Climax** (91%, p. 182)
Confrontation where truth revealed through character strength, not luck.
*Technique*: Resolution emerging from character arc (internal + external climax).
```

### Character Analysis Output
```
## Protagonist: Sarah Chen

**Want**: Solve the murder to restore her reputation
**Need**: Learn to trust others and accept help
**Flaw**: Hyper-independence stemming from childhood abandonment
**Arc**: Closed/growth arc (changes by accepting partnership)

**Characterization Techniques:**
1. *Action before description*: First appearance shows her solving a puzzle, establishing competence before physical details
2. *Contradictions*: Brilliant detective + messy personal life = dimensional character
3. *Dialogue voice*: Clipped sentences, technical jargon, humor as deflection
4. *Internal conflict*: Constant tension between wanting to go alone vs needing help

**Application**: Notice how author establishes competence first, flaws second - creates respect before sympathy.
```

### Prose Analysis Output
```
## Sentence Metrics
- Average sentence length: 14.2 words
- Range: 3-38 words
- Variety: High (simple, compound, complex well-balanced)

## Dialogue Ratio
- 42% dialogue, 58% narrative
- Attribution: 70% action beats, 30% "said" tags
- Subtext frequency: High (characters rarely say what they mean directly)

## Show vs Tell
- Estimated 75% showing, 25% telling
- Telling used for: transitions, backstory, time passage
- Showing used for: character emotion, relationship dynamics, key reveals

## Application Insights
1. Sentence variety creates rhythm (short for impact, long for complexity)
2. Heavy action-beat attribution keeps scenes visual and kinetic
3. Telling isn't bad - it's used strategically for efficiency
```

## Tips for Better Results

### Before Upload
- **Choose the right sample**: Full chapters work better than fragments
- **Quality matters**: Published, edited work gives clearer technique signals
- **Know your goal**: What specifically do you want to learn?

### During Analysis
- **Be patient**: Quality analysis takes time
- **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, request elaboration
- **Request examples**: Ask for specific quotes demonstrating techniques

### After Analysis
- **Apply immediately**: Try one technique in your current chapter
- **Build incrementally**: Master one technique before adding another
- **Revisit**: Analysis reports deepen with multiple readings

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I analyze my own work?**
A: Yes! The Editor agent is better for critique, but Librarian can analyze your techniques objectively.

**Q: How many texts should I analyze?**
A: Quality over quantity. Deep analysis of 5-10 texts in your genre > superficial analysis of 50.

**Q: Can I compare two different books?**
A: Yes! Use the "Compare texts" menu option for side-by-side analysis.

**Q: What if the text is in another language?**
A: Currently English only. Translation quality would affect analysis accuracy.

**Q: Can I analyze short stories or novellas?**
A: Absolutely. Shorter works can reveal technique more clearly.

*Remember: Analysis is not about copying - it's about understanding craft principles you can apply in your own voice.*
