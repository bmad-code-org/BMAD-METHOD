# Narrative Techniques Reference

A comprehensive guide to core storytelling techniques used across all genres.

## Show vs Tell

### Definition
**Show**: Present events through action, dialogue, and sensory details - let readers experience and conclude
**Tell**: Directly state information, emotions, or facts - inform readers explicitly

### When to Show
- Emotional moments (character feelings, relationship dynamics)
- Key plot events (discoveries, confrontations, decisions)
- Character revealing actions
- Sensory experiences that create atmosphere
- Relationship dynamics

### When to Tell
- Transitions between scenes
- Time passage
- Backstory or exposition that doesn't warrant full scene
- Minor details needed for clarity
- Summarizing less important events

### Technique: Show Through...
1. **Action**: "She slammed the door" not "She was angry"
2. **Dialogue**: Character says something revealing
3. **Body language**: "His hands trembled" not "He was nervous"
4. **Sensory details**: What character sees/hears/smells/touches/tastes
5. **Internal reaction**: Thoughts/feelings in character's voice

### Example
**Telling**: Sarah was nervous about the interview.
**Showing**: Sarah's heel tapped against the tile. She smoothed her skirt for the third time, rehearsing answers she'd already memorized.

## POV (Point of View)

### First Person
**Structure**: I/me/my/we
**Strengths**: Intimacy, voice, immediacy
**Challenges**: Limited knowledge, single perspective
**Best for**: Character-driven stories, unreliable narrators, YA

**Example**: "I couldn't believe what I was seeing. My hands went numb."

### Third Person Limited
**Structure**: He/she/they (one character's perspective at a time)
**Strengths**: Intimacy + flexibility, can switch POV between chapters
**Challenges**: Still limited to one consciousness at a time
**Best for**: Most commercial fiction, multiple POV novels

**Example**: "Sarah couldn't believe what she was seeing. Her hands went numb."

### Third Person Omniscient
**Structure**: He/she/they (narrator knows all, can enter any mind)
**Strengths**: Flexibility, irony, big-picture view
**Challenges**: Harder to create intimacy, old-fashioned feel
**Best for**: Epic scope stories, ensemble casts, literary fiction

**Example**: "Sarah couldn't believe what she was seeing, though Tom, watching from across the street, had expected this all along."

### Deep POV
A subset of third limited that stays very close to character consciousness:
- No filter words ("she saw," "he heard," "she felt")
- Character's vocabulary and sentence structure
- Immediate sensory experience
- Thoughts integrated seamlessly

**Example**: 
- Filter version: "She felt the cold wind on her face"
- Deep POV: "The wind bit her cheeks"

## Dialogue Techniques

### Subtext
Characters say one thing, mean another. The real conversation happens beneath the words.

**Example**:
"Nice dress," he said.
"My mother picked it out."
"She has good taste."
"She thinks so."

*Subtext: He's commenting on her lack of independence; she's defensive but won't confront directly.*

### Character Voice Differentiation
Each character should sound unique through:
- Vocabulary (formal/casual, simple/complex)
- Sentence structure (fragments vs complete sentences)
- Verbal tics or phrases
- Topics they raise
- What they avoid saying

### Attribution Balance
- **"Said" is invisible**: Don't avoid it
- **Action beats**: "He turned away. 'I can't do this.'"
- **No tag when obvious**: In two-person dialogue, alternate
- **Avoid fancy tags**: whispered/muttered/exclaimed used sparingly

### Exposition in Dialogue
**Bad**: "As you know, Bob, we've been friends for ten years since we met in college..."
**Good**: Make it natural, relevant, something they'd actually say

## Scene Structure

### Scene vs Sequel
**Scene** (action/external):
- Goal: Character wants something specific
- Conflict: Obstacles prevent easy achievement
- Disaster: Things go wrong, worse than before

**Sequel** (reaction/internal):
- Reaction: Emotional response to disaster
- Dilemma: What are the options now?
- Decision: Choice that launches next scene

Alternate scene-sequel for pacing rhythm.

### Scene Purpose
Every scene must:
1. Advance plot OR
2. Develop character OR
3. Both (ideal)

If it does neither, cut it.

### Opening Hook
Start scenes:
- In medias res (in the middle of action)
- With immediate conflict or question
- With character decision/realization
- With sensory detail that creates atmosphere

Avoid: Weather, waking up, looking in mirror

### Ending Hook
End scenes/chapters with:
- Cliffhanger (immediate danger)
- Revelation (new information)
- Decision (character commits to action)
- Question (reader wants answer)
- Emotional shift

## Foreshadowing

### Types
1. **Concrete**: Specific object/event mentioned early, pays off later (Chekhov's gun)
2. **Thematic**: Early events echo later patterns
3. **Dialogue**: Character says something that becomes ironic later
4. **Atmospheric**: Mood/weather hints at what's coming
5. **Symbolic**: Images/metaphors that gain meaning

### Rules
- Must be subtle enough readers don't predict everything
- Must be clear enough readers go "Oh!" when they connect dots
- Plant early, payoff later (not immediately)
- Not every planted detail must payoff (red herrings)

### Example
Early: "She'd always been afraid of confined spaces. Something about the walls closing in."
Later: Trapped in a literal confined space, but the walls closing in are also her life circumstances.

## Character Arc

### Want vs Need
- **Want**: External, conscious goal (solve the mystery, get the job, win the race)
- **Need**: Internal, what they must learn/become to be fulfilled (trust others, find self-worth, let go of past)

Arc = Journey from pursuing want → realizing need → fulfilling need (which may or may not give them the want)

### Arc Types
1. **Positive/Growth**: Character changes, overcomes flaw, gets need
2. **Negative/Fall**: Character refuses to change, succumbs to flaw
3. **Flat**: Character doesn't change, but changes the world around them

### Flaw/Misbelief
Character believes something false that holds them back:
- "I can only rely on myself" → must learn to trust
- "I'm not worthy of love" → must learn self-acceptance
- "The end justifies the means" → must learn morality matters

Arc shows them confronting and overcoming this misbelief.

## Pacing

### Techniques for Faster Pacing
- Shorter sentences and paragraphs
- More dialogue, less description
- Action scenes (conflict, movement)
- Higher stakes, ticking clocks
- Revelations and twists
- Chapter breaks at tense moments

### Techniques for Slower Pacing
- Longer, complex sentences
- Description and atmosphere
- Internal reflection
- Backstory integration
- Sequel scenes (emotional processing)
- World-building

### Balance
Vary pacing:
- Fast scenes followed by slow (like interval training)
- Gradual escalation (increasing tension toward climax)
- Genre expectations (thriller = mostly fast, literary = more slow)

---

## Sensory Details

### The Five Senses
Most writers overuse sight. Add:
- **Sound**: What does character hear?
- **Smell**: Most evocative, ties to memory
- **Touch**: Temperature, texture, physical sensation
- **Taste**: Often neglected, powerful for food/kissing/disgust scenes

### Rules
- Choose specific over generic ("diesel fumes" not "bad smell")
- Use what matters to POV character
- Create atmosphere and emotion
- Don't catalogue all five senses - select meaningfully

### Example
**Generic**: "The room was nice."
**Specific**: "Sunlight warmed the hardwood floor. The scent of lemon polish lingered, sharp and clean."

---

## Tension Techniques

### Create Tension Through:
1. **Withholding information**: Reader knows character doesn't
2. **Stakes**: What character stands to lose
3. **Time pressure**: Deadlines, ticking clocks
4. **Conflicting goals**: Characters at cross-purposes
5. **Unresolved questions**: Mysteries, unanswered questions
6. **Character in jeopardy**: Physical, emotional, social
7. **Difficult choices**: Dilemmas with no good option

### Sustaining Tension
- Answer one question, raise another
- Small victories lead to bigger problems
- Escalate stakes progressively
- Give character brief respite before next challenge
- Keep outcome genuinely uncertain

## Revision Principles

### First Draft
- Permission to be imperfect
- Get the story down
- Discovery writing allowed
- Momentum over quality

### Second Draft (Developmental)
- Fix plot holes and pacing issues
- Strengthen character arcs
- Cut scenes that don't serve story
- Reorganize if needed
- Ensure thematic coherence

### Third Draft (Line Level)
- Sharpen prose
- Vary sentence structure
- Cut redundancy
- Strengthen voice
- Show more, tell less

### Final Draft (Copy Edit)
- Grammar and punctuation
- Consistency (names, details, timeline)
- Typos
- Formatting

### Kill Your Darlings
If it doesn't serve the story, cut it - even if you love the writing.
