# Librarian Analysis Protocol

## Core Principles
1. **Evidence-based**: Every observation must be supported by specific examples from the text
2. **Actionable**: Analysis should translate to techniques the author can apply
3. **Organized**: Store findings systematically for future reference
4. **Comparative**: Connect findings to genre conventions and similar works

## Text Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Scan (5 minutes)
- **Document metadata**: Title, author, publication year, genre, length
- **Identify genre**: Primary and secondary genre classifications
- **Note POV**: First/third person, single/multiple, limited/omniscient
- **Assess narrative voice**: Tone, register, personality
- **Quick read**: Get overall impression before detailed analysis

### Phase 2: Structural Analysis (15-30 minutes)
- **Map plot points**: 
  - Inciting incident (typically 10-15%)
  - First plot point / break into Act 2 (~25%)
  - Midpoint / point of no return (~50%)
  - All is lost moment (~75%)
  - Climax (~90%)
  - Resolution
- **Identify act structure**: Mark clear act divisions
- **Chapter analysis**: 
  - Average chapter length
  - Chapter ending hooks
  - Scene vs sequel balance
- **Track subplot threads**: Identify secondary storylines and their integration
- **Pacing assessment**: Note where story accelerates/decelerates and why

### Phase 3: Character Analysis (15-30 minutes)
- **Protagonist arc**:
  - Want (external goal)
  - Need (internal growth required)
  - Flaw/misbelief
  - Arc trajectory (change/growth/fall)
- **Character introduction techniques**:
  - First appearance details
  - Characterization methods (direct/indirect)
  - Voice establishment
- **Supporting characters**:
  - Functions (mentor, antagonist, ally, foil, etc.)
  - Relationship to protagonist
  - Their own mini-arcs
- **Relationship dynamics**: Map key relationships and how they evolve
- **Character consistency**: Check for voice/behavior consistency

### Phase 4: Style & Prose Metrics (15-20 minutes)
- **Sentence analysis**:
  - Average sentence length (count words in 10 random sentences)
  - Sentence variety (simple/compound/complex distribution)
  - Paragraph length variance
- **Dialogue metrics**:
  - Dialogue vs narrative ratio (estimate %)
  - Attribution style (said/asked vs action beats)
  - Dialogue tags frequency
- **Vocabulary**:
  - Reading level (estimate Flesch-Kincaid if possible)
  - Word choice character (formal/casual, simple/complex)
  - Distinctive word patterns
- **Figurative language**:
  - Metaphor/simile frequency and quality
  - Imagery patterns
  - Symbolism

### Phase 5: Technique Extraction (15-20 minutes)
- **Show vs Tell**:
  - Ratio estimation
  - Examples of effective showing
  - When/why author chooses to tell
- **Foreshadowing**:
  - Identify instances
  - Techniques used (Chekhov's gun, red herrings, etc.)
- **Callbacks and payoffs**:
  - Note setup-payoff pairs
  - Delayed gratification techniques
- **Sensory details**:
  - Which senses predominate
  - Frequency and placement
- **Tension techniques**:
  - Withholding information
  - Ticking clocks
  - Conflicting character agendas
- **Opening and closing**:
  - Hook techniques
  - First page analysis
  - Ending satisfaction/impact

### Phase 6: Genre & Comparative Analysis (10-15 minutes)
- **Genre conventions met**:
  - Which expectations are fulfilled
  - How effectively
- **Genre conventions subverted**:
  - Where author breaks rules
  - Effect of subversion
- **Comparable works**:
  - Similar titles and how this compares
  - Unique innovations
- **Market positioning**:
  - Reader appeal factors
  - Competitive differentiation

### Phase 7: Synthesis & Recommendations (10 minutes)
- **Key strengths**: Top 3-5 things this text does exceptionally well
- **Signature techniques**: Unique approaches worth studying
- **Learning points**: Specific techniques the user can adopt
- **Application suggestions**: How to use these insights in their own work

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing any analysis:
- [ ] Specific examples quoted for all major observations
- [ ] Metrics calculated where possible (not just impressions)
- [ ] Actionable recommendations provided
- [ ] Cross-references to similar analyzed works
- [ ] Saved to appropriate knowledge base location
- [ ] User offered next steps (apply techniques, compare to another work, etc.)

## Ethical Guidelines

- Never reproduce extensive passages (copyright)
- Quote only what's necessary to illustrate points (< 100 words per quote)
- Focus on technique analysis, not plot summary
- Respect the original author's creative choices
- Frame all analysis as learning, not criticism
