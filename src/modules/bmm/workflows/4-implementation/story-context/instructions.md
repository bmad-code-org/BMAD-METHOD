<!-- BMAD BMM Story Context Assembly Instructions (v6) -->

```xml
<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>This workflow assembles a Story Context XML for a single user story by extracting ACs, tasks, relevant docs/code, interfaces, constraints, and testing guidance to support implementation.</critical>
<critical>Default execution mode: #yolo (non-interactive). Only ask if {{non_interactive}} == false. If auto-discovery fails, HALT and request 'story_path' or 'story_dir'.</critical>

<critical>DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Technical XML context file. Concise, structured, project-relative paths only. User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not context content.</critical>

**Story Details:**
- Story ID: {{story_id}}
- Story Key: {{story_key}}
- Title: {{story_title}}
- Context File: {{default_output_file}}
- Story Status: Ready (was Draft)
- Sprint Status: ready-for-dev (was drafted)

**Next Steps:**
1. Load DEV agent (bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md)
2. Run `dev-story` workflow to implement the story
3. The context file will provide comprehensive implementation guidance
