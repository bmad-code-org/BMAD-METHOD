# Sprint Status Template
# This is an EXAMPLE showing the expected format
# The actual file will be generated with all epics/stories from your epic files

# generated: {date}
# project: {project_name}
# project_key: {project_key}
# tracking_system: {tracking_system}
# story_location: {story_location}

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not started
#   - in-progress: Epic has at least one story in progress
#   - done: Epic completed (all stories done)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created by create-story workflow with comprehensive context (Status: ready-for-dev)
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation (dev-story workflow)
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review (code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed and reviewed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - completed: Retrospective has been done (retrospective workflow)
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Run create-story to create detailed story implementation documents
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - Create next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review' when complete, code-review marks as 'done'

# EXAMPLE STRUCTURE (your actual epics/stories will replace these):
