# Sprint Status Template
# This is an EXAMPLE showing the expected format
# The actual file will be generated with all epics/stories from your epic files

# generated: {date}
# project: {project_name}
# project_key: {project_key}
# tracking_system: {tracking_system}
# story_location: {story_location}

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Mark epic as 'in-progress' when starting work on its first story
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
#
# PROVIDER CONFIGURATION:
# =======================
# For GitHub Issues:
#   tracking_system: github-issues
#   repo: owner/repo-name
#   milestone: "Sprint: ProjectName - Epic 1"  # Created by sprint-planning
#
# For Azure DevOps:
#   tracking_system: azure-devops
#   org_url: https://dev.azure.com/your-org
#   project: YourProjectName
#   iteration: "Sprint: ProjectName - Epic 1"  # Created by sprint-planning
#
# For File-System Only (no external tracking):
#   tracking_system: file-system
#
# TRACKING REFERENCES:
# ====================
# Each story can have a tracking_ref field added automatically:
#   1-1-user-authentication:
#     status: ready-for-dev
#     tracking_ref: 42  # GitHub issue number or Azure DevOps work item ID
#
# Epic tracking references:
#   epic_issue_1: 40     # GitHub: epic issue number
#   epic_work_item_1: 100  # Azure DevOps: epic work item ID

# EXAMPLE STRUCTURE (your actual epics/stories will replace these):
