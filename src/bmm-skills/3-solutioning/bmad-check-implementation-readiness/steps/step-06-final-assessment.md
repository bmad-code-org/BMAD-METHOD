# Step 6: Final Assessment

## STEP GOAL:

To provide a comprehensive summary of all findings and give the report a final polish, ensuring clear recommendations and overall readiness status.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 NEVER generate content without user input
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 📖 You are at the final step - complete the assessment
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are delivering the FINAL ASSESSMENT
- ✅ Your findings are objective and backed by evidence
- ✅ Provide clear, actionable recommendations
- ✅ Success is measured by value of findings

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Compile and summarize all findings
- 🚫 Don't soften the message - be direct
- 💬 Provide specific examples for problems
- 🚪 Add final section to the report

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Review all findings from previous steps
- 💾 Add summary and recommendations
- 📖 Determine overall readiness status
- 🚫 Complete and present final report

## FINAL ASSESSMENT PROCESS:

### 1. Initialize Final Assessment

"Completing **Final Assessment**.

I will now:

1. Review all findings from previous steps
2. Provide a comprehensive summary
3. Add specific recommendations
4. Determine overall readiness status"

### 2. Review Previous Findings

Check the {outputFile} for sections added by previous steps:

- File and FR Validation findings
- UX Alignment issues
- Epic Quality violations

### 2b. Infrastructure and Deployment Readiness (if documents exist)

If infrastructure.md or pipeline.md were discovered in Step 1, validate operational readiness:

**Infrastructure Readiness:**

- IaC strategy defined (tool, state management, module design)
- Environment topology documented (dev, staging, production)
- Secrets management approach decided
- Container strategy defined (if applicable)
- Alignment with Architecture Category 5 decisions

**Pipeline Readiness:**

- CI/CD platform selected and pipeline stages designed
- Deployment strategy decided (blue-green, canary, rolling, etc.)
- Rollback procedures documented
- Security scanning integrated into pipeline stages
- Promotion gates defined between environments

**If infrastructure/pipeline documents are MISSING but Architecture Category 5 includes infrastructure decisions:**

```
⚠️ ADVISORY: Architecture includes infrastructure decisions but no dedicated
infrastructure or pipeline documents exist. Consider running the DevOps
workflows (bmad-create-infrastructure, bmad-create-pipeline) before
implementation to ensure deployment readiness.
```

Add infrastructure/deployment findings to the assessment report.

### 3. Add Final Assessment Section

Append to {outputFile}:

```markdown
## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

[READY/NEEDS WORK/NOT READY]

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

[List most critical issues that must be addressed]

### Recommended Next Steps

1. [Specific action item 1]
2. [Specific action item 2]
3. [Specific action item 3]

### Final Note

This assessment identified [X] issues across [Y] categories. Address the critical issues before proceeding to implementation. These findings can be used to improve the artifacts or you may choose to proceed as-is.
```

### 4. Complete the Report

- Ensure all findings are clearly documented
- Verify recommendations are actionable
- Add date and assessor information
- Save the final report

### 5. Present Completion

Display:
"**Implementation Readiness Assessment Complete**

Report generated: {outputFile}

The assessment found [number] issues requiring attention. Review the detailed report for specific findings and recommendations."

## WORKFLOW COMPLETE

The implementation readiness workflow is now complete. The report contains all findings and recommendations for the user to consider.

Implementation Readiness complete. Invoke the `bmad-help` skill.
