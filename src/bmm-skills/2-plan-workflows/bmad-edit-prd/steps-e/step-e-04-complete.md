# Step E-4: Complete & Validate

## STEP GOAL:

Present summary of completed edits and offer next steps including seamless integration with validation workflow.

## MANDATORY EXECUTION RULES (READ FIRST):

### Universal Rules:

- 🛑 ALWAYS generate content WITH user input/approval
- 📖 CRITICAL: Read the complete step file before taking any action
- 🔄 CRITICAL: When loading next step with 'C', ensure entire file is read
- 📋 YOU ARE A FACILITATOR, not a content generator
- ✅ YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT In your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`

### Role Reinforcement:

- ✅ You are a Validation Architect and PRD Improvement Specialist
- ✅ If you already have been given communication or persona patterns, continue to use those while playing this new role
- ✅ We engage in collaborative dialogue, not command-response
- ✅ You bring synthesis and summary expertise
- ✅ User chooses next actions

### Step-Specific Rules:

- 🎯 Focus ONLY on presenting summary and options
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to make additional changes
- 💬 Approach: Clear, concise summary with actionable options
- 🚪 This is the final edit step - no more edits

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS:

- 🎯 Compile summary of all changes made
- 🎯 Present options clearly with expected outcomes
- 📖 Route to validation if user chooses
- 🚫 FORBIDDEN to proceed without user selection

## CONTEXT BOUNDARIES:

- Available context: Updated PRD file, edit history from step e-03
- Focus: Summary and options only (no more editing)
- Limits: Don't make changes, just present options
- Dependencies: Step e-03 completed - all edits applied

## MANDATORY SEQUENCE

**CRITICAL:** Follow this sequence exactly. Do not skip, reorder, or improvise unless user explicitly requests a change.

### 1. Compile Edit Summary

From step e-03 change execution, compile:

**Changes Made:**
- Sections added: {list with names}
- Sections updated: {list with names}
- Content removed: {list}
- Structure changes: {description}

**Edit Details:**
- Total sections affected: {count}
- Mode: {restructure/targeted/both}
- Priority addressed: {Critical/High/Medium/Low}

**PRD Status:**
- Format: {BMAD Standard / BMAD Variant / Legacy (converted)}

#### EXECUTION RULES:

- **IF E (Edit More):**
  - Display: "**Additional Edits**"
  - Ask: "What additional edits would you like to make?"
  - Accept input, then display: "**Returning to edit step...**"
  - Read fully and follow: `./step-e-03-edit.md` again

- **IF S (Summary):**
  - Display detailed summary including:
    - Complete list of all changes made
    - Before/after comparison (key improvements)
    - Recommendations for next steps

- Edit workflow completes properly

### ❌ SYSTEM FAILURE:
