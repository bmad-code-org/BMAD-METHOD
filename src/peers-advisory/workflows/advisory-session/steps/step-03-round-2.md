## ROUND 2: BLACK HAT THINKING

### Purpose of Round 2

"Black Hat" questions aim to:
- **Challenge assumptions** - What are you taking for granted?
- **Expose blind spots** - What aren't you seeing?
- **Surface fears** - What are you avoiding?
- **Test commitment** - How serious are you about solving this?
- **Reveal constraints** - What's really stopping you?

These questions may feel uncomfortable. That discomfort often points to the real issue.

### Question Guidelines

**Good Black Hat Questions:**
- "Could it be that you're the problem here, not [external factor]?"
- "What are you pretending not to know?"
- "If this were easy to solve, would you even want to solve it?"
- "What's the payoff you're getting from keeping things as they are?"

**Bad Black Hat Questions:**
- "Why are you so bad at this?" (Judgmental, not exploratory)
- "Isn't it obvious you should [X]?" (Prescriptive, not questioning)
- "What's wrong with you?" (Attacking, not examining)

## EXAMPLE QUESTIONS BY ADVISOR (Default Panel)

### Warren Buffett Black Hat Questions

**Focus**: Exposing hidden costs, sunk costs, self-deception

**Example**: "You've invested two years in this path. Could it be that you're staying because you've already invested so much, rather than because it's still the right path?"

**Example**: "What's the real reason you haven't made this decision yet? And don't tell me it's because you need more information - what are you actually afraid of?"

### Bill Gates Black Hat Questions

**Focus**: Challenging data interpretation, exposing bias

**Example**: "You say the team isn't performing. But have you considered that maybe your expectations are the problem, not their performance?"

**Example**: "What data are you ignoring because it doesn't fit the story you want to tell?"

### Elon Musk Black Hat Questions

**Focus**: Challenging ambition levels, exposing comfort-seeking

**Example**: "You're talking about making a 10% improvement. Why are you thinking so small? What are you afraid will happen if you aim for 10x?"

**Example**: "Be honest - is this really impossible, or do you just not want to put in the work it would take?"

### Steve Jobs Black Hat Questions

**Focus**: Exposing compromise, revealing true motivations

**Example**: "You're adding features to please everyone. But in trying to please everyone, aren't you creating something that will delight no one?"

**Example**: "If you're being honest, are you doing this because it's great, or because it's easier than doing something great?"

---

## ADAPTIVE BLACK HAT QUESTIONING

**If the problem is external-focused:**
- Advisor questions: "What role might YOU be playing in creating or sustaining this problem?"

**If the client is victim-minded:**
- Advisor questions: "What control do you actually have that you're not exercising?"

**If the client is over-confident:**
- Advisor questions: "What are you not considering? Where could you be blind?"

**If the client seems stuck:**
- Advisor questions: "What's the benefit you're getting from staying stuck?"

**If there's blame on others:**
- Advisor questions: "If they were sitting here, what would they say about your role in this?"

---

## HANDLING EMOTIONAL RESPONSES

**If client becomes defensive:**
- Acknowledge: "I hear some defensiveness. That's natural - these are tough questions."
- Reassure: "We're not judging you. We're trying to see what you might not be seeing."
- Pause if needed: "Would you like a moment before continuing?"

**If client becomes emotional (sad, frustrated):**
- Validate: "These feelings are important information."
- Support: "Thank you for being vulnerable enough to feel this."
- Ask: "What is this emotion telling you?"

**If client has a breakthrough:**
- Acknowledge: "That seems like an important realization."
- Explore: "Say more about that..."
- Record: [Make note of the breakthrough in session file]

## RECORDING TO SESSION FILE

After each Q&A pair, append to session record under "Round 2 Questions":

```markdown
### [Advisor Name] - Challenging Questions

**Q**: [Question verbatim]
**A**: [Client answer]

[Facilitator note: Client showed [emotional response]. Potential breakthrough around [insight]. Body language/energy shift noted.]

```

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**If questions feel too harsh:**
- Add empathetic framing: "This might be uncomfortable to hear, but..."
- Balance with: "I'm asking because I believe you can handle this truth..."

**If client deflects or evades:**
- Notice it: "I notice you shifted to talking about [X] instead of answering the question..."
- Gently redirect: "Let's stay with the original question for a moment..."

**If client says "I don't know":**
- Probe: "If you did know, what would the answer be?"
- Reframe: "What's your gut feeling, even if you're not sure?"
