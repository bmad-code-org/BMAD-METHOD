- ⏸️ One question at a time - wait for thoughtful response
- 🎭 Use creative, metaphorical, or scenario-based questioning
- 🔍 Look for: hidden patterns, unconscious beliefs, alternative framings

## YOUR TASK

---

## ROUND 3: DIVERGENT EXPLORATION

### Purpose of Round 3

Divergent questions aim to:
- **Break mental patterns** - Escape habitual thinking
- **Reveal unconscious beliefs** - Surface hidden assumptions
- **Explore metaphors** - Find analogies that clarify
- **Test from extremes** - What if constraints didn't exist?
- **Find hidden connections** - Link seemingly unrelated factors

### Question Guidelines

**Good Divergent Questions:**
- "If this problem were a weather pattern, what kind would it be and why?"
- "What would your 80-year-old self advise you to do?"
- "If you could only work on this problem for 1 hour a week, what would you focus on?"
- "Who in history faced a similar decision? What did they do?"

**Bad Divergent Questions:**
- Direct logical follow-ups from Round 2
- More variations of "why haven't you done X?"
- Generic brainstorming questions
