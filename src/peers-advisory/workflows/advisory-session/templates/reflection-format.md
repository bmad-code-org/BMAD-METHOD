# Advisor Reflection Format Template

This template defines the structure for advisor reflections in Step 08.

## Standard Reflection Structure

Each advisor must provide ALL 5 components:

### 1. Your Strengths

Identify positive qualities demonstrated during the session:
- Base on actual observations from the session
- Look for strengths that contrast with their struggle
- 2-3 sentences with specific examples

**Format:**
```
**Your Strengths**

[Describe 1-2 strengths with specific examples of how they showed up in the session]
```

### 2. Potential Traps

Describe how these strengths, when over-developed, become liabilities:
- Not criticism - growth awareness
- Show the shadow side of their gifts
- 2-3 sentences

**Format:**
```
**Potential Traps**

[Describe how their strengths, taken to extreme, could become problematic. Include specific examples of what this looks like.]
```

### 3. Others' Strengths

If client mentioned someone specific, analyze that person's effectiveness:
- What makes that person successful?
- What can the client learn from them?
- 2-3 sentences

**If no one was mentioned, replace with additional observation:**

**Format:**
```
**Others' Strengths**

[Analysis of someone the client mentioned, or alternative observation]
```

Or:

```
**One Thing I Noticed**

[Additional insight about the client]
```

### 4. What Triggers You

Explore who/what annoys the client and why:
- Often reveals suppressed parts of themselves
- Asked gently, with curiosity
- 2-3 sentences

**Format:**
```
**What Triggers You**

[Exploration of who irritates them and what this might reveal about themselves]
```

### 5. Evolution Direction

Specific growth direction that balances strengths and addresses traps:
- Concrete developmental focus
- Actionable, not abstract
- 2-3 sentences

**Format:**
```
**Evolution Direction**

[Specific characteristics or behaviors to develop, with concrete examples]
```

🔄 **Bill Gates's Reflection**

**Your Strengths**

Throughout this session, I've been impressed by your analytical thinking. When I asked about your metrics, you immediately broke down the problem into component parts. You're also remarkably honest about what you don't know - that intellectual humility is rare and valuable.

**Potential Traps**

But analysis without action is paralysis. If you always need "more data" before deciding, you'll never move. Perfect information doesn't exist. At some point, 80% certainty has to be good enough, or you'll be outmaneuvered by people who are comfortable with 60%.

**Others' Strengths**

You mentioned your competitor who "just executes without thinking." Maybe they're not thoughtless - maybe they've just optimized for speed over perfection. Their bias toward action, even imperfect action, is something you could learn from.

**What Triggers You**

I suspect people who "shoot from the hip" irritate you. But consider: what if your need for thorough analysis is sometimes a form of procrastination? The people who trigger us often show us what we're avoiding in ourselves.

**Evolution Direction**

Your growth edge is developing "good enough decision-making." Set a data threshold: "I'll make this decision with 3 data points, not 30." Practice making reversible decisions quickly and irreversible decisions slowly. Most decisions are reversible.

Trust your analysis, then act on it.

— Bill
