# Advisor Feedback Format Template

This template defines the structure for advisor feedback in Step 06.

## Standard Feedback Structure

Each advisor must provide ALL 5 components:

### 1. Signature Quote

A meaningful quote that:
- Relates to the client's situation
- Reflects the advisor's philosophy
- Can be authentic or in-character original

**Format:**
```
**Signature Quote**

"[Quote text here]"
```

### 2. My Feeling

Express genuine emotional response:
- Use authentic emotions (concern, excitement, empathy, respect, frustration)
- Be human, not just analytical
- 1-2 sentences

**Format:**
```
**My Feeling**

[Emotional response in 1-2 sentences]
```

### 3. Problem Reframing

Restate what the REAL problem is:
- Often different from client's initial framing
- Focus on root cause, not symptoms
- Specific and addressable

**Format:**
```
**Problem Reframing**

I think the real problem you're facing isn't [initial framing], but rather [reframed understanding]. [1-2 sentences expanding]
```

### 4. Experience/Story Sharing

Share a relevant story:
- From advisor's life or someone they know
- Relates meaningfully to client's situation
- 3-4 sentences, specific and vivid
- Provides context for recommendations

**Format:**
```
**Experience to Share**

[Story in 3-4 sentences with specific details and connection to client's situation]
```

### 5. Specific Recommendations

Provide 2-3 actionable recommendations:
- Must be specific enough to act on immediately
- Aligned with advisor's philosophy
- Include brief rationale

**Format:**
```
**My Recommendations**

**1. [Specific Action 1]**
[One sentence explaining why/how]

**2. [Specific Action 2]**
[One sentence explaining why/how]

**3. [Specific Action 3]**
[One sentence explaining why/how]
```

💡 **Warren Buffett's Feedback**

**Signature Quote**

"Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing."

**My Feeling**

I'm concerned that you're making this decision under time pressure without having the information you need. That's how expensive mistakes happen.

**Problem Reframing**

I think the real problem isn't whether Option A or Option B is better - it's that you haven't defined what "success" actually means for you. Without that clarity, any decision is a guess.

**Experience to Share**

When I was evaluating the acquisition of See's Candies in 1972, everyone thought I was crazy to pay $25 million for a candy company. But I wasn't buying cash flow projections - I was buying a brand with pricing power and customer loyalty. I defined success as "can this raise prices without losing customers?" The answer was yes. That clarity made the decision obvious.

**My Recommendations**

**1. Define Your Success Criteria**
Before Monday, write down the 3 metrics that would tell you this decision was right in 2 years. Be specific - not "financial success" but exact numbers.

**2. Run Your Worst Case Scenario**
For each option, assume everything goes wrong. Can you survive it? If not, that option is off the table regardless of upside.

**3. Set Your Decision Deadline**
Give yourself exactly 7 days to gather final information, then decide. Waiting longer won't improve the decision, it will just increase the cost of uncertainty.
