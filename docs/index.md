## What You'll Need

BMad works with any AI coding assistant that supports custom system prompts or project context. Popular options include:

- **[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code)** — Anthropic's CLI tool (recommended)
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** — AI-first code editor
- **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)** — Codeium's AI IDE
- **[Roo Code](https://roocode.com)** — VS Code extension

You should be comfortable with basic software development concepts like version control, project structure, and agile workflows. No prior experience with BMad-style agent systems is required—that's what these docs are for.
