# Gracefully Age - Nano-Banana Pro Prompt

Age this technical diagram to look like a 1960s archival document.

CRITICAL - TEXT MUST BE PERFECT:

- Every letter, number, and symbol must remain crisp and undistorted
- No warping, smearing, or altering of ANY text
- No changes to lines, arrows, or box shapes
- Preserve all elements exactly as shown

ONLY apply:

- Aged paper texture (cream/yellowed) - Keep in mind that this image already looks like old paper, with its yellowish background and faded pastel tones.
- Subtle coffee stain in top-left corner
- Subtle fold creases
- Lightly worn edges and corners
- Light vignette

DO NOT apply any effect that distorts text. If in doubt, leave it alone.

NO watermarks or AI signatures.

## POST-PROCESSING

Nano-Banana will add a 4-pointed star watermark in the bottom-right. Remove it using the instructions in README.md.
