# How to Set Up CI Pipeline with TEA

Use TEA's `*ci` workflow to scaffold production-ready CI/CD configuration for automated test execution with selective testing, parallel sharding, and flakiness detection.

## When to Use This

- Need to automate test execution in CI/CD
- Want selective testing (only run affected tests)
- Need parallel execution for faster feedback
- Want burn-in loops for flakiness detection
- Setting up new CI/CD pipeline
- Optimizing existing CI/CD workflow

## Prerequisites

- BMad Method installed
- TEA agent available
- Test framework configured (run `*framework` first)
- Tests written (have something to run in CI)
- CI/CD platform access (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)

## Steps

### 1. Load TEA Agent

Start a fresh chat and load TEA:

```
*tea
```

### 2. Run the CI Workflow

```
*ci
```

### 3. Select CI/CD Platform

TEA will ask which platform you're using.

**Supported Platforms:**
- **GitHub Actions** (most common)
- **GitLab CI**
- **Circle CI**
- **Jenkins**
- **Other** (TEA provides generic template)

**Example:**
```
GitHub Actions
```

### 4. Configure Test Strategy

TEA will ask about your test execution strategy.

#### Repository Structure

**Question:** "What's your repository structure?"

**Options:**
- **Single app** - One application in root
- **Monorepo** - Multiple apps/packages
- **Monorepo with affected detection** - Only test changed packages

**Example:**
```
Monorepo with multiple apps
Need selective testing for changed packages only
```

#### Parallel Execution

**Question:** "Want to shard tests for parallel execution?"

**Options:**
- **No sharding** - Run tests sequentially
- **Shard by workers** - Split across N workers
- **Shard by file** - Each file runs in parallel

**Example:**
```
Yes, shard across 4 workers for faster execution
```

**Why Shard?**
- **4 workers:** 20-minute suite → 5 minutes
- **Better resource usage:** Utilize CI runners efficiently
- **Faster feedback:** Developers wait less

#### Burn-In Loops

**Question:** "Want burn-in loops for flakiness detection?"

**Options:**
- **No burn-in** - Run tests once
- **PR burn-in** - Run tests multiple times on PRs
- **Nightly burn-in** - Dedicated flakiness detection job

**Example:**
```
Yes, run tests 5 times on PRs to catch flaky tests early
```

**Why Burn-In?**
- Catches flaky tests before they merge
- Prevents intermittent CI failures
- Builds confidence in test suite

### 5. Review Generated CI Configuration

TEA generates platform-specific workflow files.

#### GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test.yml`):

```yaml
name: Test Suite

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Nightly at 2 AM

    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        shard: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code

      - name: Run burn-in loop
        run: |
          for i in {1..5}; do
            echo "=== Burn-in iteration $i/5 ==="
            npx playwright test --grep-invert "@skip" || exit 1
          done

      - name: Upload burn-in results
        if: failure()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: burn-in-failures

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Run selective tests
        run: npm run test:changed
```

#### GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`):

```yaml
variables:
  NODE_VERSION: "18"

stages:
  - test
  - burn-in

# Test job with parallel execution
test:
  stage: test
  image: node:$NODE_VERSION
  parallel: 4
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npx playwright install --with-deps
    - npx playwright test --shard=$CI_NODE_INDEX/$CI_NODE_TOTAL
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:
      - test-results/
      - playwright-report/
    expire_in: 7 days
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH

# Burn-in job for flakiness detection
burn-in:
  stage: burn-in
  image: node:$NODE_VERSION
  script:
    - npm ci
    - npx playwright install --with-deps
    - |
      for i in {1..5}; do
        echo "=== Burn-in iteration $i/5 ==="
        npx playwright test || exit 1
      done
  artifacts:
    when: on_failure
    paths:
      - test-results/
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
```

#### Helper Scripts

TEA generates shell scripts for CI and local development.

**Test Scripts** (`package.json`):

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "playwright test",
    "test:headed": "playwright test --headed",
    "test:debug": "playwright test --debug",
    "test:smoke": "playwright test --grep @smoke",
    "test:critical": "playwright test --grep @critical",
    "test:changed": "./scripts/test-changed.sh",
    "test:burn-in": "./scripts/burn-in.sh",
    "test:report": "playwright show-report",
    "ci:local": "./scripts/ci-local.sh"
  }
}
```

**Selective Testing Script** (`scripts/test-changed.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run only tests for changed files

CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD)

if echo "$CHANGED_FILES" | grep -q "src/.*\.ts$"; then
  echo "Running affected tests..."
  npm run test:e2e -- --grep="$(echo $CHANGED_FILES | sed 's/src\///g' | sed 's/\.ts//g')"
else
  echo "No test-affecting changes detected"
fi
```

**Burn-In Script** (`scripts/burn-in.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Run tests multiple times to detect flakiness

ITERATIONS=${BURN_IN_ITERATIONS:-5}
FAILURES=0

for i in $(seq 1 $ITERATIONS); do
  echo "=== Burn-in iteration $i/$ITERATIONS ==="

  if npm test; then
    echo "✓ Iteration $i passed"
  else
    echo "✗ Iteration $i failed"
    FAILURES=$((FAILURES + 1))
  fi
done

if [ $FAILURES -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Tests failed in $FAILURES/$ITERATIONS iterations"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ All $ITERATIONS iterations passed"
```

**Local CI Mirror Script** (`scripts/ci-local.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Mirror CI execution locally for debugging

echo "🔍 Running CI pipeline locally..."

# Lint
npm run lint || exit 1

# Tests
npm run test || exit 1

# Burn-in (reduced iterations for local)
for i in {1..3}; do
  echo "🔥 Burn-in $i/3"
  npm test || exit 1
done

echo "✅ Local CI pipeline passed"
```

**Make scripts executable:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

**Alternative: Smart Burn-In with Playwright Utils**

If `tea_use_playwright_utils: true`, you can use git diff-based burn-in:

```typescript
// scripts/burn-in-changed.ts
import { runBurnIn } from '@seontechnologies/playwright-utils/burn-in';

async function main() {
  await runBurnIn({
    configPath: 'playwright.burn-in.config.ts',
    baseBranch: 'main'
  });
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

```typescript
// playwright.burn-in.config.ts
import type { BurnInConfig } from '@seontechnologies/playwright-utils/burn-in';

const config: BurnInConfig = {
  skipBurnInPatterns: ['**/config/**', '**/*.md', '**/*types*'],
  burnInTestPercentage: 0.3,  // Run 30% of affected tests
  burnIn: { repeatEach: 5, retries: 1 }
};

export default config;
```

**Benefits over shell script:**
- Only runs tests affected by git changes (faster)
- Smart filtering (skips config, docs, types)
- Volume control (run percentage, not all tests)

**Example:** Changed 1 file → runs 3 affected tests 5 times = 15 runs (not 500 tests × 5 = 2500 runs)

### 6. Configure Secrets

TEA provides a secrets checklist.

**Required Secrets** (add to CI/CD platform):

```markdown
## GitHub Actions Secrets

Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

### Required
- None (tests run without external auth)

### Optional
- `TEST_USER_EMAIL` - Test user credentials
- `TEST_USER_PASSWORD` - Test user password
- `API_BASE_URL` - API endpoint for tests
- `DATABASE_URL` - Test database (if needed)
```

**How to Add Secrets:**

**GitHub Actions:**
1. Go to repo Settings → Secrets → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add name and value
4. Use in workflow: `${{ secrets.TEST_USER_EMAIL }}`

**GitLab CI:**
1. Go to Project Settings → CI/CD → Variables
2. Add variable name and value
3. Use in workflow: `$TEST_USER_EMAIL`

### 7. Test the CI Pipeline

#### Push and Verify

**Commit the workflow file:**
```bash
git add .github/workflows/test.yml
git commit -m "ci: add automated test pipeline"
git push
```

**Watch the CI run:**
- GitHub Actions: Go to Actions tab
- GitLab CI: Go to CI/CD → Pipelines
- Circle CI: Go to Pipelines

**Expected Result:**
```
✓ test (shard 1/4) - 3m 24s
✓ test (shard 2/4) - 3m 18s
✓ test (shard 3/4) - 3m 31s
✓ test (shard 4/4) - 3m 15s
✓ burn-in - 15m 42s
```

#### Test on Pull Request

**Create test PR:**
```bash
git checkout -b test-ci-setup
echo "# Test" > test.md
git add test.md
git commit -m "test: verify CI setup"
git push -u origin test-ci-setup
```

**Open PR and verify:**
- Tests run automatically
- Burn-in runs (if configured for PRs)
- Selective tests run (if applicable)
- All checks pass ✓

## Tips

### Start Simple, Add Complexity

**Week 1:** Basic pipeline
```yaml
- Run tests on PR
- Single worker (no sharding)
```

**Week 2:** Add parallelization
```yaml
- Shard across 4 workers
- Faster feedback
```

**Week 3:** Add selective testing
```yaml
- Git diff-based selection
- Skip unaffected tests
```

**Week 4:** Add burn-in
```yaml
- Detect flaky tests
- Run on PR and nightly
```

### Optimize for Feedback Speed

**Goal:** PR feedback in < 5 minutes

**Strategies:**
- Shard tests across workers (4 workers = 4x faster)
- Use selective testing (run 20% of tests, not 100%)
- Cache dependencies (`actions/cache`, `cache: 'npm'`)
- Run smoke tests first, full suite after

**Example fast workflow:**
```yaml
jobs:
  smoke:
    # Run critical path tests (2 min)
    run: npm run test:smoke

  full:
    needs: smoke
    # Run full suite only if smoke passes (10 min)
    run: npm test
```

### Use Test Tags

Tag tests for selective execution:

```typescript
// Critical path tests (always run)
test('@critical should login', async ({ page }) => { });

// Smoke tests (run first)
test('@smoke should load homepage', async ({ page }) => { });

// Slow tests (run nightly only)
test('@slow should process large file', async ({ page }) => { });

// Skip in CI
test('@local-only should use local service', async ({ page }) => { });
```

**In CI:**
```bash
# PR: Run critical and smoke only
npx playwright test --grep "@critical|@smoke"

# Nightly: Run everything except local-only
npx playwright test --grep-invert "@local-only"
```

### Monitor CI Performance

Track metrics:

```markdown
## CI Metrics

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| PR feedback time | < 5 min | 3m 24s | ✅ |
| Full suite time | < 15 min | 12m 18s | ✅ |
| Flakiness rate | < 1% | 0.3% | ✅ |
| CI cost/month | < $100 | $75 | ✅ |
```

### Handle Flaky Tests

When burn-in detects flakiness:

1. **Quarantine flaky test:**
```typescript
test.skip('flaky test - investigating', async ({ page }) => {
  // TODO: Fix flakiness
});
```

2. **Investigate with trace viewer:**
```bash
npx playwright show-trace test-results/trace.zip
```

3. **Fix root cause:**
- Add network-first patterns
- Remove hard waits
- Fix race conditions

4. **Verify fix:**
```bash
npm run test:burn-in -- tests/flaky.spec.ts --repeat 20
```

### Secure Secrets

**Don't commit secrets to code:**
```yaml
# ❌ Bad
- run: API_KEY=sk-1234... npm test

# ✅ Good
- run: npm test
  env:
    API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
```

**Use environment-specific secrets:**
- `STAGING_API_URL`
- `PROD_API_URL`
- `TEST_API_URL`

### Cache Aggressively

Speed up CI with caching:

```yaml
# Cache node_modules
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    cache: 'npm'

# Cache Playwright browsers
- name: Cache Playwright browsers
  uses: actions/cache@v4
  with:
    path: ~/.cache/ms-playwright
    key: playwright-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
```

## Common Issues

### Tests Pass Locally, Fail in CI

**Symptoms:**
- Green locally, red in CI
- "Works on my machine"

**Common Causes:**
- Different Node version
- Different browser version
- Missing environment variables
- Timezone differences
- Race conditions (CI slower)

**Solutions:**
```yaml
# Pin Node version
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version-file: '.nvmrc'

# Pin browser versions
- run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium@1.40.0

# Set timezone
  env:
    TZ: 'America/New_York'
```

### CI Takes Too Long

**Problem:** CI takes 30+ minutes, developers wait too long.

**Solutions:**
1. **Shard tests:** 4 workers = 4x faster
2. **Selective testing:** Only run affected tests on PR
3. **Smoke tests first:** Run critical path (2 min), full suite after
4. **Cache dependencies:** `npm ci` with cache
5. **Optimize tests:** Remove slow tests, hard waits

### Burn-In Always Fails

**Problem:** Burn-in job fails every time.

**Cause:** Test suite is flaky.

**Solution:**
1. Identify flaky tests (check which iteration fails)
2. Fix flaky tests using `*test-review`
3. Re-run burn-in on specific files:
```bash
npm run test:burn-in tests/flaky.spec.ts
```

### Out of CI Minutes

**Problem:** Using too many CI minutes, hitting plan limit.

**Solutions:**
1. Run full suite only on main branch
2. Use selective testing on PRs
3. Run expensive tests nightly only
4. Self-host runners (for GitHub Actions)
