# Contributing to BMAD Documentation

This directory contains internal guidelines for maintaining consistent, high-quality documentation across the BMAD Method project.

## Style Guides

- [Tutorial Style Guide](./tutorial-style.md) — Formatting standards for tutorials and getting-started guides

## Quick Principles

1. **Clarity over brevity** — Be concise, but never at the cost of understanding
2. **Consistent structure** — Follow established patterns so readers know what to expect
3. **Strategic visuals** — Use admonitions, tables, and diagrams purposefully
4. **Scannable content** — Headers, lists, and callouts help readers find what they need

## Directory Purpose

This `_contributing/` directory is prefixed with underscore to exclude it from the Docusaurus sidebar. These documents are for contributors and maintainers, not end users.
