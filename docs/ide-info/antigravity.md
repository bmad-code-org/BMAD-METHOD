# BMAD Method - Google Antigravity Instructions

## Activating Agents

BMAD agents are installed as slash commands in `.agent/workflows/` with flattened
`bmad-*.md` naming.

### How to Use

1. **Type Slash Command**: Start with `/` to see available commands
2. **Select Agent**: Choose from `bmad-` prefixed commands
3. **Execute**: Press Enter to activate that agent persona

### Examples

```
/bmad-bmm-agents-dev - Activate development agent
/bmad-bmm-agents-architect - Activate architect agent
/bmad-bmm-workflows-dev-story - Execute dev-story workflow
```

### Notes

- Commands are autocompleted when you type `/`
- All BMAD items start with `bmad-`
- Agent remains active for the conversation
- Start a new conversation to switch agents
