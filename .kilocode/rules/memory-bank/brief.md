# BMAD-METHOD Project Brief

## Overview

BMAD-METHOD is a universal human-AI collaboration platform that amplifies human potential through specialized AI agents. The project consists of three main components:

- **BMAD-CORE**: The foundational Collaboration Optimized Reflection Engine that orchestrates specialized agents
- **BMM (BMad Method)**: Flagship agile development framework for software and game development
- **BMB (BMad Builder)**: Tools for creating custom agents, workflows, and modules
- **CIS (Creative Intelligence Suite)**: Innovation and creativity workflows (beta)

## Current Version

**v6 Alpha** - Under active development on `v6-alpha` branch

- Previous stable: v4.x
- Installation: `npx bmad-method@alpha install`

## Core Philosophy: C.O.R.E.

- **C**ollaboration: Human-AI partnership leveraging unique strengths
- **O**ptimized: Refined processes for maximum effectiveness
- **R**eflection: Guided thinking that unlocks better solutions
- **E**ngine: Powerful framework orchestrating specialized agents

## Key Agents

- **BMad Master**: Central orchestrator and workflow executor
- **PM**: Product planning and requirements
- **Analyst**: Research and business analysis
- **Architect**: Technical architecture and design
- **Scrum Master**: Sprint planning and story management
- **Developer**: Implementation with senior review
- **BMad Builder**: Custom agent and workflow creation

## Mission

Transform how humans and AI work together by providing structured workflows, specialized agents, and reflective processes that bring out the best in both—replacing AI-driven answers with AI-guided discovery.
