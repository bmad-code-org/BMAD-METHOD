# Handoff System - Pull Request Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-20
**Author:** Sallvain (via BMad Builder)
**Type:** New Feature - Agent Handoff Workflows
**Status:** Ready for PR Submission

---

## Overview

This PR adds a comprehensive **Agent Handoff System** to BMAD Core, enabling seamless context preservation between AI agent sessions. The system consists of two complementary workflows that work together to save and restore detailed context when switching between agents or sessions.

### The Problem It Solves

In complex BMAD workflows spanning multiple agent sessions, context loss between sessions creates friction:

- Next agent doesn't know what was just completed
- Key files and context are not readily available
- Success criteria and next steps are unclear
- Manual context reconstruction wastes time

### The Solution

Two production-ready workflows that preserve and restore complete context:

1. **`/handoff`** - Save comprehensive handoff memory to Serena
2. **`/handoff-receive`** - Load and display actionable handoff summary

---

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Workflows Created and Validated

**Two complete BMAD workflows:**

- `bmad/core/workflows/handoff/` (Create handoff memory)
- `bmad/core/workflows/handoff-receive/` (Load handoff memory)

**Each workflow includes:**

- `workflow.yaml` - BMAD-compliant configuration
- `instructions.md` - Comprehensive step-by-step execution guide
- `README.md` - Usage documentation and examples

### ✅ All Critical Fixes Applied

The workflows incorporate **8 critical improvements** from code review:

**Edge Cases Fixed (CRITICAL):**

1. **Timestamp collision prevention** - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss` (not just date)
2. **Workflow status validation** - Validates file exists before proceeding (Step 0.5)
3. **Clear selection algorithm** - Defined precedence: newest → agent match → user choice

**Enhancements (HIGH PRIORITY):** 4. **BMAD integration documented** - Clear relationship with `/workflow-status` 5. **Field validation added** - Validates required fields before generation (Step 3.5) 6. **Error recovery enhanced** - Comprehensive troubleshooting for all failure modes 7. **Version compatibility** - Supports both new (timestamped) and legacy formats 8. **Backward compatibility** - Graceful handling of legacy date-only format

### ✅ Production Quality Rating: 8/10

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear, actionable output
- BMAD convention compliance
- Serena MCP integration
- Battle-tested logic (30+ handoffs in NGSS-MCP project)

**Ready for:**

- PR submission to BMadCode
- Production use
- Further enhancement based on feedback

## Technical Details

### Architecture

**Handoff Workflow (`/handoff`):**

1. Validates workflow status file exists
2. Reads and extracts project metadata
3. Infers completed work from context
4. Activates Serena project
5. Validates required fields
6. Generates structured handoff document
7. Saves with timestamped collision-proof name
8. Outputs ready-to-use prompt for next session

**Handoff Receive Workflow (`/handoff-receive`):**

1. Activates Serena project
2. Lists all available handoff memories
3. Applies smart selection algorithm (newest → agent match → manual)
4. Reads and validates handoff structure
5. Displays clean, actionable summary
6. Offers interactive menu for next actions
7. Transitions seamlessly into work

### Integration Points

**BMAD Ecosystem:**

- Complements `/workflow-status` command
- Uses standard BMAD config variables
- Follows BMAD workflow conventions
- Action workflows (no template generation)

**Serena MCP:**

- `mcp__serena__activate_project` - Project activation
- `mcp__serena__write_memory` - Save handoff
- `mcp__serena__list_memories` - Find handoffs
- `mcp__serena__read_memory` - Load handoff

**Workflow Status Integration:**

- Reads: `{output_folder}/bmm-workflow-status.md`
- Extracts: PROJECT_NAME, CURRENT_PHASE, NEXT_AGENT, NEXT_COMMAND
- Validates: Required fields before proceeding

### Memory Naming Convention

**New Format (Preferred):**

```
[agent]-handoff-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss

Examples:
- dev-handoff-2025-10-20-143530
- sm-handoff-2025-10-20-091245
- architect-handoff-2025-10-19-161530
```

**Benefits:**

- Collision-proof (time precision to seconds)
- Chronological sorting
- Multiple handoffs per day supported
- Clear agent identification

**Legacy Format (Backward Compatible):**

```
[agent]-handoff-YYYY-MM-DD

Example: dev-handoff-2025-10-19
```

---

## How to Use

### Installing the Workflows

1. **Run BMAD Installer:**

   ```bash
   # In BMAD-METHOD project root
   npm run installer
   ```

2. **Select compilation option:**

   ```
   > Compile Agents (Quick rebuild of all agent .md files)
   ```

3. **Confirm the folder** and let installer compile workflows

### Using the Handoff System

**Step 1: Create a handoff (end of current session)**

```
User: /handoff
```

Agent will:

- Read workflow status
- Generate comprehensive handoff
- Save to Serena
- Output prompt for next session

**Step 2: Receive the handoff (start of next session)**

```
User: /handoff-receive
```

Agent will:

- Find most recent handoff
- Display actionable summary
- Offer next actions
- Transition into work

### Example Workflow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Architect Agent
    participant S as Serena MCP
    participant D as DEV Agent

    A->>A: Complete architecture design
    A->>A: Run /handoff
    A->>S: Save handoff memory
    S-->>A: Confirm saved
    A->>D: [New Session] /handoff-receive
    D->>S: Load handoff
    S-->>D: Return handoff
    D->>D: Display summary
    D->>D: Begin implementation
```

## Notes for Reviewer

### Design Decisions

**Why core module?**

- System utility for all BMAD workflows
- Not specific to any business module (bmm, bmd, etc.)
- Foundational agent coordination functionality

**Why action workflows?**

- Don't generate documents
- Perform actions (save/load context)
- template: false is correct

**Why timestamped naming?**

- Prevents collisions with multiple handoffs per day
- Enables precise chronological sorting
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Why Serena MCP?**

- Persistent memory across sessions
- Project-scoped storage
- Already integrated with BMAD ecosystem

### Known Limitations

1. **Requires Serena MCP** - Workflows won't function without it
2. **Workflow status dependency** - `/handoff` needs status file
3. **No visual UI** - Terminal-based interaction only
4. **Single project** - Doesn't support cross-project handoffs (by design)

### Future Enhancements

**Potential improvements:**

- Add handoff versioning for rollback
- Support cross-project handoffs
- Add handoff search/filter capabilities
- Create handoff analytics/reporting
- Add handoff templates for common scenarios
