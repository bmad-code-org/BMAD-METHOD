Subject: Review — Professional Journaling MVP (30–45m)

Hi <PO name>,

We’d like to invite you to a brief review of the Professional Journaling MVP handoff so you can sign off on the P0 decisions and see a short demo of the core flow (capture → transcribe → generate → publish).

Proposed agenda (30–45 minutes)
- 5m: Quick context and goals
- 15m: Demo — capture → transcribe → generate → publish (dev-mode)
- 10m: Review decisions & acceptance criteria
- 10m: Confirm next steps and owners

Pre-read: please open these files before the meeting
- `HANDOFF-README.md`
- `DEMO-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- `PM-DECISIONS.md`
- `ARCHITECT-HANDOFF.md`

How we’ll demo (dev-machine)
1. We’ll run the serverless-starter dev server locally and open a small demo page (no real LinkedIn publish unless you provide credentials).
2. Steps we will run:
   - Start dev server: `DEV_MODE=1 npm run dev`
   - Open demo: `http://localhost:3000/demo/oauth-demo.html`
   - Run a short audio capture simulation, transcribe, generate two variants, and simulate publish

Please reply with availability for a 30–45 minute slot this week. Suggested times:
- Option 1: <date/time A>
- Option 2: <date/time B>
- Option 3: <date/time C>

If you prefer, we can also record the demo and send it ahead of time and use the meeting for Q&A and sign-off.

Thanks — looking forward to the review.

Best,
<Tech lead / Babz>
