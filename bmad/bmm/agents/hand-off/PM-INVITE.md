Subject: 30-min Review — AI Journaling → LinkedIn (BMAD Method)

Hi <PM name>,

I'd like to invite you to a 30-minute review of the AI-powered journaling MVP we're preparing. The app captures text and voice, transcribes with Whisper, and converts entries into LinkedIn-ready posts using OpenAI. We have a short demo and a proposed 3-month sprint plan.

Proposed times:
- Option A: [Date] [Time]
- Option B: [Date] [Time]

Agenda (30 mins):
1. 5 min — Overview & persona
2. 10 min — Live demo (capture → transcribe → convert → publish)
3. 10 min — Decisions: retention default, LinkedIn publish policy, monetization
4. 5 min — Next steps & owners

Please let me know which time works and whether you prefer a 30- or 45-minute slot.

Thanks,
Babz
