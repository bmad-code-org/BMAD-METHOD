Subject: [Review] Professional Journaling MVP — 30–45 minutes

Hi <PO name>,

I'd like to invite you to a 30–45 minute review of the Professional Journaling MVP handoff. We will demo the core happy path and request quick decisions on retention, publish policy, and anonymization defaults so engineering can start sprint work.

Suggested slots (pick one):
- Option A: <date A, time A> (30–45m)
- Option B: <date B, time B> (30–45m)
- Option C: <date C, time C> (30–45m)

Pre-read (5–10m): `bmad/bmm/agents/hand-off/PO-REVIEW.md` and `DEMO-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

Meeting agenda
1. Context & goals (5m)
2. Demo — capture → transcribe → generate → publish (15m)
3. Decisions & acceptance criteria (10m)
4. Sprint planning & owners (10m)

How we’ll run the demo
- Tech lead will run the serverless dev server locally and present the demo page. The demo uses dev-mode tokens and will not post to LinkedIn unless you provide credentials.

If you accept one of the slots above, I'll send a calendar invite with the pre-read attached. If you'd prefer a recorded demo & async sign-off, say so and I will produce a short recording.

Thanks,
<Tech lead / Babz>
