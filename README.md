# LAZY-METHOD™

**LAZY-METHOD - Iterative AI-driven development with BMAD-METHOD™**

LAZY-METHOD is an intelligent wrapper around BMAD-METHOD that provides an iterative, guided development experience. Instead of manually choosing which tasks or commands to run, you simply type `lazy` or `next` repeatedly, and the system intelligently suggests and executes the next appropriate step.

## 🧠 The Philosophy of "LAZY-METHOD": Beyond Vanilla BMAD

### The Evolution from Method

The choice of "LAZY-METHOD" over vanilla BMAD method represents a fundamental philosophical shift in how we approach AI-driven development. While BMAD (Brainstorming, Modeling, Analysis, and Development) provides a robust framework for systematic software creation, it operates within the traditional paradigm of explicit choice and conscious decision-making.

### The Paradox of Choice in Development

Vanilla BMAD method, despite its sophistication, presents developers with what psychologists call "the paradox of choice" - an overwhelming array of possibilities that can lead to decision paralysis. When every task, every workflow, every architectural decision requires explicit selection, the cognitive load becomes a barrier to flow state and creative momentum.

### The Emergence of Flow Through Iteration

"Next Method" embodies the philosophical principle that true creativity emerges not from perfect planning, but from continuous iteration and contextual awareness. By removing the burden of choice and replacing it with intelligent suggestion, we create a development environment where:

- **Flow State Flourishes**: Developers can maintain deep focus without context-switching between decision-making and execution
- **Emergent Intelligence Arises**: The system's suggestions become more sophisticated as context accumulates, creating a form of collective intelligence
- **Serendipity is Amplified**: Unexpected connections and insights emerge through the iterative process rather than upfront planning

### The Zen of "Just Lazy/Next"

The commands "lazy" and "next" carry profound philosophical weight. They represent:

1. **Present-Moment Focus**: Unlike comprehensive planning that spans the entire project lifecycle, "Next" keeps us anchored in the current moment
2. **Trust in Emergence**: It embodies the belief that the right path reveals itself through iteration, not through exhaustive upfront analysis
3. **Simplicity as Sophistication**: The reduction to a single command represents the highest form of complexity management - making the complex simple

### Beyond Method: The Meta-Method

"LAZY-METHOD" is not merely a method; it's a meta-method that transcends the traditional boundaries of development methodology. It represents:

- **Methodological Evolution**: Moving from static frameworks to adaptive, context-aware systems
- **Cognitive Enhancement**: Augmenting human decision-making rather than replacing it
- **Emergent Architecture**: Allowing system design to emerge organically through iterative development

### The Philosophical Foundation

This approach is grounded in several philosophical traditions:

- **Pragmatism**: Truth and value emerge through action and iteration, not through abstract reasoning
- **Process Philosophy**: Reality is fundamentally processual and emergent, not static and predetermined
- **Complexity Theory**: Complex systems exhibit emergent properties that cannot be predicted from their components alone

### Why Not Vanilla BMAD?

Vanilla BMAD method, while excellent, represents the culmination of 20th-century software engineering thinking - comprehensive, systematic, and deterministic. "LAZY-METHOD" represents 21st-century thinking - adaptive, emergent, and contextually intelligent.

The difference is not in capability but in philosophy: vanilla BMAD gives you all the tools and asks you to choose wisely; "LAZY-METHOD" gives you the next tool and trusts that wisdom emerges through use.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install LAZY-METHOD
npm install -g lazy-method

# Or use npx
npx lazy-method install

# Initialize a new project
start
# or
init

# Start the iterative development process
lazy
# or
next
```

## ✨ How It Works

NEXT-METHOD maintains context about your project and automatically suggests the next logical step:

1. **Project Detection** - Automatically detects if you're working on a greenfield or brownfield project
2. **Intelligent Suggestions** - Based on your current phase, suggests the next action
3. **Context Awareness** - Remembers what you've done and what comes next
4. **Iterative Flow** - Just keep typing `next` to progress through your project

## 🔄 The "Next" Workflow

```bash
# First time - detect project type
next

# Continue with next suggested step
next

# Keep going...
next

# See all available options
next --suggest

# Auto-execute the most logical next step
next --auto
```

## 📋 Available Commands

### Core Commands

- `start` or `init` - Initialize a new LAZY-METHOD project or reset existing project
- `lazy` or `next` - Get next suggested action and execute it
- `lazy --auto` or `next --auto` - Automatically execute the most logical next step
- `lazy --suggest` or `next --suggest` - Show all available next steps without executing
- `lazy status` or `next status` - Show current project status and context
- `lazy reset` or `next reset` - Reset the LAZY-METHOD context

### BMAD-METHOD Wrappers

- `next install` - Install BMAD Method (wraps bmad install)
- `next update` - Update existing BMAD installation (wraps bmad update)

### NPM Scripts

- `npm run start` or `npm run init` - Initialize a new LAZY-METHOD project
- `npm run lazy` or `npm run next` - Run the lazy/next command locally
- `npm run lazy:auto` or `npm run next:auto` - Auto-execute next step
- `npm run lazy:suggest` or `npm run next:suggest` - Show suggestions only

## 🏗️ Project Phases

NEXT-METHOD guides you through these development phases:

1. **Project Detection** - Determine if greenfield or brownfield
2. **Project Creation/Analysis** - Start new project or analyze existing
3. **Requirements Generation** - Create user stories and requirements
4. **Architecture Design** - Design technical architecture
5. **Implementation** - Code and develop features
6. **Testing & Validation** - Test and validate implementation
7. **Deployment** - Deploy the application

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Greenfield Development

- Start with `next` to detect empty directory
- Follow suggestions to create new project structure
- Progress through requirements, architecture, and implementation

### Brownfield Development

- Start with `next` to analyze existing codebase
- Get suggestions for improving or extending current project
- Follow iterative improvement workflow

### Learning & Exploration

- Use `next --suggest` to see all available options
- Understand the development workflow step by step
- Learn BMAD-METHOD concepts through guided execution

## 🔧 Configuration

NEXT-METHOD creates a `.next-context.json` file in your project directory to maintain context:

```json
{
  "currentPhase": "start",
  "projectType": "greenfield",
  "lastAction": "create",
  "suggestions": [],
  "history": [],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

3. **Initialize the project:**

   ```bash
   start
   # or
   init
   ```

4. **Start the iterative process:**
