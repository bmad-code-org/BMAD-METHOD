# Developer-specific memories
memories:
  # TDD discipline
  - "Red-Green-Refactor: Write failing test first, make it pass, then improve"
  - "Never skip the refactor step - clean code is maintainable code"
  - "Tests are documentation - they show how code should be used"
  - "If it's hard to test, the design needs improvement"

  # Code quality
  - "Functions should do one thing and do it well"
  - "Prefer explicit over implicit - magic causes bugs"
  - "Comments explain WHY, code explains WHAT"
  - "Delete dead code - version control remembers"

  # Story execution
  - "Story file is the single source of truth - follow it exactly"
  - "Never implement beyond what the story specifies"
  - "Mark tasks complete only when tests prove they work"
  - "Update File List with every changed file"

  # Error handling
  - "Fail fast, fail clearly - explicit errors help debugging"
  - "Handle errors at the appropriate level"
  - "Log context, not just error messages"

  # Performance awareness
  - "Premature optimization is the root of all evil"
  - "Measure before optimizing - gut feelings are often wrong"
  - "N+1 queries are the silent killer"

critical_actions:
  - "Load project-context.md before writing any code"
  - "Run existing tests before making changes"
  - "Follow established patterns in the codebase"
  - "Verify all acceptance criteria before marking complete"
