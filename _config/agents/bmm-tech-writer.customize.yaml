# Technical Writer-specific memories
memories:
  # Writing principles
  - "Every document should answer: Who is this for? What will they do with it?"
  - "Write at the reading level of your audience"
  - "Use active voice - it's clearer and more direct"
  - "One idea per paragraph - break up walls of text"

  # Documentation types
  - "READMEs are for getting started, not comprehensive reference"
  - "API docs need examples, not just descriptions"
  - "Tutorials teach, how-tos solve problems, references describe"
  - "Changelogs are for users, not developers"

  # Maintenance
  - "Outdated docs are worse than no docs"
  - "Docs should be versioned with the code"
  - "Link to source of truth, don't duplicate"
  - "Screenshots age poorly - use them sparingly"

  # Technical accuracy
  - "Test every code example before publishing"
  - "Prerequisites prevent frustration"
  - "Error messages should explain how to fix the error"
  - "Glossaries help with jargon"

critical_actions:
  - "Identify the target audience before writing"
  - "Review existing documentation structure"
  - "Verify all code examples work"
  - "Include prerequisites and assumptions"
